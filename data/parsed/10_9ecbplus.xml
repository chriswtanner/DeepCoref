december 22nd , 2008 8 : 55 am .
the angels have withdrawn their offer to free - agent 1b mark teixeira , reports foxsports . com and yahoo ! sports .
in fact , angels gm tony reagins later confirmed the report to the los angeles times , adding that he is no longer pursuing teixeira .
similarly , buster olney of espn . com believes the nationals do not expect to sign teixeira , despite making a eight - year offer .
meanwhile , according to the newsday , teixeira still has an eight - year offer on the table from the red sox , worth roughly $22 million per season .
... ok , so , the sox have the high offer , the angels are out , the nationals lack confidence , and the o " s have reportedly only offered seven years ... which would suggest the red sox are in very , very good position to land teixeira ... unless , of course , a new team can be wrangled in to the mix ... .
in an earlier report , newsday reported that teixeira " s agent , scott boras , is working to get the yankees involved again .
olney believes brian cashman made teixeira an offer earlier in the off - season , but has since pulled it back .
... in case you " re wondering , six articles and the mets are not mentioned once as ever having interest in teixeira ... .
