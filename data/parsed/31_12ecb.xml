hansbrough breaks unc scoring record .
the tar heels and the purple aces play a game , but the attention is on record-setting unc senior tyler hansbrough .
since the day he stepped foot on north carolina 's campus , forward tyler hansbrough has been working to diversify his offensive resume by trying to extend his shooting range .
but it seemed appropriate that when it came time to break unc 's three-decades-old career scoring record during the top-ranked tar heels ' 91-73 basketball victory over evansville on thursday night , the senior went back to an old staple : a workmanlike power move .
with 7:42 left in the first half at the smith center , hansbrough muscled around purple aces forwards james haarsma and pieter van tongeren to bank in a shot off the glass and score his 10th point of the game and 2,292nd point of his career .
that basket broke the mark of 2,290 that point guard phil ford set from 1974 to 1978 .
hansbrough finished with 20 points and now has 2,302 for his career .
" it was very fitting -- three guys on him , he was moving to the basket , kind of off-balance , he banks it in with his soft hands , " said gene hansbrough , who surprised his son by attending the game .
" it was a perfect shot for tyler to break the record on . " .
point guard ty lawson also chipped in 16 points for the tar heels ( 10-0 ) , though coach roy williams looked frustrated at times by his team 's performance , particularly after evansville 's shy ely ended the first half with a dunk .
that led the coach to stomp off the court despite the fact that his team led by 18 points .
the night , however , belonged to hansbrough , who accepted the game ball and an embrace from ford , now an assistant coach for the nba 's charlotte bobcats , immediately after setting the record .
after the game , ford pressed his hands together and bowed to the big man at mid-court , congratulating him as fans in the sellout crowd -- some of whom held signs reading " phil ford 2,290 " on one side and " tyler 2,291 + " on the other -- were on their feet for a rousing ovation .
" it 's an honor to be compared in the same breath at tyler , " ford said later .
" when i see how hard he plays , and how he listens to coach williams -- as a player , that 's why i tried to do . " .
then hansbrough -- who followed his record-breaking bucket with a missed dunk attempt that probably will make the team blooper reel -- choked up as he watched a montage of current and former players congratulate him on the accomplishment .
" i got a little emotional , because you may not know all those guys [ in the video ] , but you 've got a connection , because you played here and you 're part of something that i consider a family , " he said .
hansbrough , who also grabbed nine rebounds , had already secured his place in tar heels history -- and in the retired jersey portion of the smith center rafters , near ford -- by earning consensus national player-of-the-year honors last season .
breaking such a long-standing record adds to his still-blooming legend .
ford passed the likes of lennie rosenbluth , charles scott and larry miller because they could play varsity basketball for only three years .
antawn jamison , michael jordan and rashad mccants failed to pass ford because they stayed just three seasons .
then came hansbrough , the sometimes awkward-looking big man from poplar bluff , mo. , who opted to forgo going to the nba after his freshman , sophomore and junior seasons in order to try to win an ncaa title .
although he said he was a little nervous straying from the lane his rookie season , he actually scored his first tar heels bucket on nov. 19 , 2005 , when he led a three-on-two fast break against gardner-webb that finished with his jump shot in the lane .
and he has barely slowed since , topping unc 's chart for all-time free-throw attempts -- he passed the 1,000 mark thursday night -- en route to his latest record .
" i wanted it on a 3 , " hansbrough said of the record-setting bucket , " but in a game , i realize you have to do what you have to do . " .
which in his case , means playing with power and honing his improving finesse .
if he remains healthy , the combination probably will help him become the acc 's all-time leading scorer , as well .
former duke star j.j. redick holds that mark with 2,769 points .
" i do n't put anything past tyler .
if somebody tells me he 's going to break the nba scoring record -- boy , that 's going to be hard -- but you never say never when it comes to tyler , " gene hansbrough said .
" he 's got a strong will . " .
danny green ( 14 points ) became the 61st player in unc history to score 1,000 points when he buried a 3-pointer in the second half .
