" bettie page is the last great icon of the 1950s , " james swanson , co-author of " bettie page .
the life of a pinup legend , " said in a 1996 interview with nbc 's real life program .

early years .
bettie mae page was born on april 22 , 1923 , in nashville , tennessee .
the second of six children , she helped raise her younger siblings while the family traveled around the u.s. in search of work .
page 's mother placed her daughters in an orphanage after divorcing her husband , who was sentenced to two years in an atlanta penitentiary for stealing a policeman 's car .

in 1947 , she filed for divorce and moved to new york .
three years later while walking on coney island , she met police officer jerry tibbs who had an interest in photography and assembled page 's first portfolio .
tibbs introduced her to camera clubs , men 's hobbyist groups that sometimes acted as a front for erotic photography , and page 's career took off .
she then appeared in publisher robert harrison 's girlie magazines wink , flirt and beauty parade .
in january 1955 , she was the centerfold model in hugh hefner 's fledgling playboy magazine , one month before actress jayne mansfield appeared as the publication 's playmate .
" she had a saucy innocence that is both contemporary and provocative , and also nostalgic , " hefner said .
media mogul .
page , who claimed she ignored media mogul howard hughes 's request for a screen test in 1955 because she did n't want to sleep with him , also studied acting under herbert berghoff at sea cliff summer theater on long island .
the apprenticeship helped her gain parts in new york stage productions and on television , once appearing on " the jackie gleason show . " .
some of her most celebrated snapshots were taken in 1954 during a session with photographer bunny yeager at the africa usa wildlife park in boca raton , florida .
they included nude poses with two cheetahs and scenes in a leopard-patterned jungle outfit that she made herself .
her " dark angel " image stemmed from bondage and fetish sessions for irving klaw 's movie star news .
klaw , who paid $ 80 for four hours ' work at his studio in greenwich village , new york , required sadomasochistic shots to meet the demand of high- profile , educated clients .
his sister paula created the sets and helped page develop the fetish image .
'very sweet ' .
" paula was one of the nicest women i 've ever known in my life , " page said .
" only paula was allowed to tie us up .
she was very gentle , caring and considerate .
she never tied any ropes too tight .
she was very sweet . " .
a congressional investigation initiated by tennessee senator estes kefauver in 1955 called page as a witness and put klaw out of business , though he had no case to answer because his models were never nude .
the evidence of obscenity had included more- explicit poses that page had done for camera clubs after a drinking session one night at a party .
the congressional probe is said to have contributed to her decision to give up modeling .
throughout the 1960s , page attended bible schools in los angeles , chicago and oregon , helping teenage mothers and visiting jails .
her breakdown in 1972 after divorcing third husband harry lear led to four months ' treatment in florida 's jackson memorial hospital and 20 months in patton state hospital in san bernardino , california .
