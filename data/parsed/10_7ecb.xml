so as things turn out , apparently there are teams in major league baseball not named the new york yankees who are willing to spend money this winter .
after letting francisco rodriguez leave to join the new york mets and failing to sign cc sabathia , the angels find themselves with some money laying around , and they 've decided to spend it on mark teixeira .
according to a report in the los angeles times , the angels have made an offer to the free agent first baseman that would be the biggest contract in the history of the franchise , surpassing the $ 90 million deal they gave to torii hunter last season .
while the numbers are n't confirmed , the deal is believed to be an offer of eight years and around $ 160 million .
owner arte moreno flew from his arizona home to las vegas on tuesday and met personally with scott boras , the agent for teixeira .
angels spokesman tim mead said he believed moreno presented the offer to boras at that time .
mead also said he did not know when the offer might expire .
the angels , of course , are one of four teams that are known to be pursuing teixeira .
the nationals offered him the same deal as the angels , the orioles have made an offer between $ 140 and $ 150 million over seven years , and nobody knows for sure what the red sox have offered .
i 'm pretty sure the red sox offer will be the only one the angels have to compete with because even though the nationals and orioles are close to teixeira 's home , neither have any realistic expectation of competing for a world series next season , with or without teixeira .
