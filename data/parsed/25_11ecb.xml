the new orleans saints placed reggie bush on the injured list on wednesday , ending the national football league season for the star running back .
the 23-year-old bush will miss the team 's final two regular season games against detroit and carolina with a sprained left knee .
bush finished his third season in new orleans with just 404 yards and two touchdowns on 106 carries .
bush suffered a left knee injury against carolina on october 19 .
he appeared to be on the mend , but he sprained the knee in last thursday 's 27-24 overtime loss at chicago and was limited to only 30 yards on six carries .
