two leaders in the polygamous community of bountiful , b.c. , have been charged with practising polygamy under the criminal code .
winston blackmore , 52 , and james oler , 44 , were arrested by rcmp on tuesday , attorney general wally oppal said at a news conference wednesday .
oler is the bishop of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints , while blackmore is the former flds bishop who was ousted in 2002 after a power struggle with the sect 's prophet warren jeffs .
the two men were to appear in court wednesday after an " intensive " seven-month investigation , oppal said .
" mr. blackmore it is alleged that he has committed polygamy with approximately 20 people , " oppal said .
" and as far as oler is concerned it is alleged that he has committed polygamy with two women . " .
blackmore has been charged with " practising polygamy " on may 1 , 2005 and oler has been charged with the same crime on nov. 1 , 2004 , according to provincial court files .
" i am pleased a prosecution will be proceeding , as it will provide legal clarity as to the constitutionality of section 293 of the criminal code ( concerning polygamy ) , " oppal said in a statement .
news of the charges was welcomed by audrey vance , co-chair of altering destiny through education , which is based in creston , b.c. , not far from bountiful .
vance has lobbied for charges against bountiful residents .
" we all know this is a cult and we have to do something to address this because in canada women do have equal rights , " she said in an interview wednesday .
blackmore , who has had 26 wives and more than 100 children , is outspoken in his belief that the charter of rights and freedoms protects his religious practice of polygamy - a tenet that was set out by mormonism 's founder joseph smith , but was denounced by the mainstream church in 1890 .
at a polygamy summit in 2006 , blackmore admitted that he had had " several " very young " wives " including one who was under 16 .
he repeated that when he was interviewed by cnn 's larry king .
blackmore lost his role as the bountiful bishop after his disagreement with jeffs , the church 's prophet who has been convicted of being an accomplice to the rape of a minor in utah and is currently in jail in arizona facing similar charges there .
jeffs and other senior flds members have also been charged in texas with offences related to the so-called " spiritual marriages " to under-aged girls .
blackmore now leads a breakaway group that lives in the southeastern corner of b.c. and is the head of the mormon hills school society , which runs a government-funded , independent school .
over the years , blackmore amassed a multi-million-dollar business empire that included a post-and-pole company , logging operations and a large farm .
little is known about oler , a mechanic .
he has never spoken to the media and there are few photos of him .
however , people within the community have confirmed that oler has at least three wives , several of whom were in their teens when they were assigned to him in placement marriages by jeffs .
