the bush administration issued two late-term regulations on thursday that environmentalists say weaken federal protection for endangered species but that interior department officials defended as blocking a " back-door " attempt to regulate emissions that contribute to global warming .
conservation groups sued to block the new rules , reigniting a fight over so-called midnight regulation that had seemed to die down a day earlier when the administration declined to impose looser air pollution rules that environmentalists had feared .
previously , federal agencies were required to consult with scientists who specialized in particular species before proceeding with a project like a road or dam .
the project could not go forward unless the specialist certified that no harm would come to endangered plants or wildlife .
the rules announced thursday would allow federal agencies to bypass those scientists in some cases if the agencies determined that the endangered species would not be harmed .
the revision was finalized after four months of deliberation and over the objections of what officials said were the bulk of nearly 235,000 public comments on the change .
the updated rules also bar agencies from stopping a project because its emissions might contribute to global warming .
opponents call the change particularly objectionable for the polar bear , which has seen its habitat shrink as arctic ice caps melt .
the government declared polar bears a threatened species this year .
interior secretary dirk kempthorne called the rule changes " narrow " and a " common-sense " approach to species protection .
he stressed that agencies could still consult with species scientists if they chose , and he reiterated his belief that climate change regulation is a " wholly inappropriate use of the endangered species act . " .
kempthorne acknowledged internal debate over the changes , but he and other administration officials said they tweaked the rule in response to public comments .
environmental groups panned them anyway .
janette brimmer , an attorney with earthjustice , said the administration was " using global warming as a stalking horse to undo species protections on a broad scale . " .
andrew wetzler , director of the natural resources defense council 's endangered species program , was blunt .
" we will see them in court . " .
environmentalists have tussled with the administration in its waning days over oil and gas drilling leases near national parks and oil shale development across the western u.s .
they cheered wednesday , however , when the environmental protection agency said it would not revise two air pollution standards .
white house officials say they 've worked hard to minimize the kind of end-of-term rulemaking that president bill clinton engaged in heavily .
many of the late rules could be difficult for president-elect barack obama to overturn without in a lengthy process , though a little-used law could allow congress to void them .
the house select committee on energy independence and global warming held a hearing on thursday into bush 's late energy and environmental rulemaking .
committee chairman rep. edward markey ( d-mass. ) said the rules issued thursday showed the administration was " determined to use every last minute in office to wreak as much havoc as possible on our nation . " .
kempthorne , for his part , sounded keenly aware of timing issues in a conference call with reporters , when he noted he had 39 days left in office .
asked if that gave him pause for issuing new rules , he replied .
" do you think eli manning should have left the field five minutes before the end of the last super bowl ? " .
