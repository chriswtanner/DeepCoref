the polygamist prophet : one step closer to a texas court .
wednesday , sept . 08 , 2010 .
the appearance was brief , perhaps two or three minutes , but the presence of warren jeffs in a salt lake city area courtroom this week revealed a man who has changed in the four years since his arrest .
the man who was once on the fbi's most wanted list looked thinner , his hair , now close - cropped , dusted with gray , and he wore a pair of frameless glasses that seemed to emphasize his most distinctive feature , his wide , compelling eyes .
jeffs has reportedly suffered from illness brought on by extended periods of prayer and fasting .
but the brief courtroom hearing with its mundane talk of calendars and hearings also brought the sometime "prophet" of a utah - based polygamist sect one step closer to a texas courtroom to face allegations of sexual assault and bigamy - perhaps law enforcement's best avenue to keep him behind bars .
jeffs and 11 members of his fundamentalist church of the latter day saints ( flds ) were charged in 2008 by texas authorities with a variety of felony charges , from bigamy to child abuse , following a raid on the group's yearning for zion ranch in tiny eldorado , texas .
seven of the men have been convicted and have received sentences ranging from 7 to 75 years ; another goes on trial this month .
jerry strickland , a spokesman for texas attorney general greg abbott told time : "whenever warren jeffs is brought to texas , we stand ready to try him on felony charges returned by a schleicher county grand jury . " .

jeffs' defense team's efforts to fight extradition are a "big long shot , " according to clifford rosky , a criminal law professor at the university of utah .
"he is going to be extradited - it's a matter of weeks , not months , " rosky says .
on tuesday , jeffs refused to sign the waiver of extradition - a move his legal team had hinted would happen after utah's gov . gary herbert accepted the extradition request by texas gov . rick perry last month .
the wrangling over his extradition will continue at a nov . 15 hearing when it is likely jeffs' legal team will argue he should remain in utah until charges against him in that state are either dropped or reinstated .

in august , the utah supreme court tossed out a 2008 conviction in state court that found jeffs was an accomplice to rape after he performed a marriage between elissa wall , 14 , and her then 19 - year - old first cousin , allen g . steed .
jeffs remains in utah prison so far , while state government is asking its high court to reconsider its ruling .
prosecutors , however , have been mum on whether they will retry jeffs .
"we don't need him here right now , " utah assistant attorney general craig barlow said , urging the court to move forward on the texas extradition .
texas prosecutors need only prove the target of their arrest warrant is the real warren jeffs and that their charges are based on some reasonable belief that a crime occurred .
during the raid on the flds ranch , texas rangers removed numerous boxes of records and computers .
later , the state assembled a detailed dna map of the 401 children removed by child protective services from the ranch , plus samples from some of their parents who agreed to testing to reclaim their children .
among the evidence was a 2006 photograph marked "anniversary" that shows jeffs kissing a 12 - year - old girl .
the photo , according to flds detractors depicts an abusive underage marriage , while supporters claim it is just a record of a symbolic kiss marking a spiritual marriage aimed at strengthening bonds between families .
but the photo is likely to be evidence in jeffs' texas trial , the sort of evidence that eluded utah prosecutors .
meanwhile , schleicher county sheriff david doran says his 15 - bed jail is ready for jeffs whenever he arrives in the small west texas town of eldorado .
the man who spent three months eluding the fbi in 2006 also could be housed in nearby san angelo , a city of some 88 , 000 residents compared to el dorado's 1 , 800 .
law enforcement continues to view him as flight risk .
tuesday's hearing was delayed as attorneys and prosecutors argued .
prosecutors wanted him in prison clothes and handcuffed , defense attorneys argued he should appear unshackled in civilian clothes .
the judge split the baby and jeffs appeared in a suit , a white shirt that looked a little large in the collar , and his hands cuffed as if in prayer .
as he appeared a dozen male members of the flds community in the courtroom audience stood and smiled at their former leader .
"he is holding up great .
he is doing just fine .
he is very appreciative of the utah supreme court's decision .
he is a prayerful man and he feels , and the people who support mr . jeffs believe , that their prayers were answered , " jeffs' attorney walter f . bugden told the salt lake tribune .
"he is a little thin , he is a little thin .
he could use some fattening up . " .
