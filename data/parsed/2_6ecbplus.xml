ellen degeneres to host next year " s oscars .
published : august 2 , 2013 .
reaching back to television for a comedy star , the producers of the academy awards telecast announced friday that ellen degeneres would return next year to host the annual oscar ceremony .
the producers , craig zadan and neil meron , caused some backlash last year after giving the job to seth macfarlane , the creator of the " family guy " animated show on the fox network .
ms . degeneres has even less to do with the theatrical movie business than mr . macfarlane does ( his movie " ted " preceded his appearance ) but she is well liked in hollywood and her performance as the host of the show in 2007 was widely praised .
in typical fashion , she released a jokey response to the honor : " i am so excited to be hosting the oscars for the second time .
you know what they say -- the third time " s the charm . " .
