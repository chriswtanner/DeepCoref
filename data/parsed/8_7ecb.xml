police responded to both , but it was an employee who found a suspicious device under the bushes outside west coast bank .
sznewajs told the statesman journal that his bank for a call " from an unknown person saying that we should look for one as well .
we called authorities , but they looked and found nothing . " .
sznewajs said that " one of our people saw a device in the bushes around the branch and called authorities .
we looked at it and evacuated the branch and sent people away . " .
