red sox - teixeira rumor .
december 15 , 2008 at 1 : 00pm cst .
2 : 16pm : take it with a grain of salt , but we have a report of a report that the red sox offered mark teixeira an eight - year , $200mm deal .
earl bloom of the orange county register heard dan patrick say it on his radio show .
it'd be best to treat the report with skepticism until it's confirmed by another source .
