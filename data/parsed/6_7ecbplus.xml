gary ross remains in negotiations to direct 'the hunger games' sequel .
wednesday , 04 april 2012 10 : 30 .
after opening to the third - biggest domestic debut weekend of all time , legitimate pop culture phenomenon the hunger games has grossed $368 . 0 million globally .
it's done so in under two weeks of theatrical release .
so with by far the biggest hit in its history , lionsgate is naturally keen to continue the series with catching fire , the already announced adaptation of suzanne collins's novel .
but apparently it's not a guarantee that gary ross , who co - wrote and directed the hunger games , will be back for another round .
lionsgate has long been open about its intent to turn collins's bestselling young adult novels into a franchise , one that would spin four movies out of the literary trilogy .
last year , the studio staked out a november 22 , 2013 release date for catching fire and pursued oscar winning slumdog millionaire screenwriter simon beaufoy to pen the script .
in january , word emerged that beaufoy was indeed at work on catching fire , and at the time , word was that he was doing so under ross's supervision , with the director set to return .
since then , it's been generally accepted that ross would take another trip to panem , particularly once the hunger games received an overwhelmingly positive critical response and , you know , made dump trucks of money .
ross has by no means been set to direct , however .
according to the hollywood reporter , he has yet to formally sign on , and negotiations might just be proceeding with some difficulty , if the process on the hunger games is any indicator .
the reports cites an anonymous source familiar with ross's negotiations last time , who cites it as , "a terrible experience . " .
lionsgate , unaccustomed to dealing with directors as established as the four time oscar nominee and pleasantville and seabiscuit director , reportedly played some hardball with ross , who ended up being paid $3 million .
that relatively low figure was no doubt helped by the 5% of the film's backend profits .
having delivered a critically acclaimed , zeitgeist - tapping event movie , ross is doubtless expecting a bigger figure for catching fire , but will lionsgate pay it ?
probably .
but maybe not .
lionsgate recently bought summit entertainment , the distributor behind the twilight franchise , meaning that the lionsgate film division is now under the auspices of summit's patrick wachsberger and rob friedman .
the revolving door of directors on the twilight series has some fans worried that a similar policy might be carried out with the hunger games sequels .
negotiations with ross didn't actually begin until roughly three weeks before the first film's release , at which point it was obvious that the film would be successful , giving no small amount of leverage to the director , who co - wrote the screenplay with collins and billy ray .
while ross wasn't signed on to multiple films , stars jennifer lawrence , josh hutcherson , and liam hemsworth are all on board for the duration of the series .
but that's not say there's no potential issues there either .
the unanimously - praised lawrence is also contractually obligated to reprise her role as mystique in a sequel to last year's x - men : first class .
her commitment there apparently supersedes her hunger games contract , meaning that if fox goes ahead with another x - men at an inconvenient moment , it could complicate the catching fire schedule .
of course , all of this could be conjecture or , at the very least , over - analysis .
let's not get hysterical just yet , folks .
