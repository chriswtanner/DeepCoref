a man said to have been released from a secure mental hospital against his wishes was yesterday being questioned over the murders of his mother and sister .
john jenkin , 23 , had been sectioned after an apparent suicide attempt in the week before the double murder .
according to a relative , he had a history of mental health problems and had pleaded in vain to be kept locked up because he feared harming himself or someone else .
police were called to the family's terraced house in millom , cumbria , at 8 . 40am on saturday and found the bodies of alice mcmeekin , 58 , and her university student daughter katie jenkin , 20 .
the family's new pet collie , fenn , was also killed .
jenkin , who was described as a goth , was arrested nearby on suspicion of murder .
he was said to have doted on his mother and younger sister , but the heavy metal fan was also obsessed with the occult .
cumbria police have not revealed how the women died , although no gun was used in the murders .
friends and neighbours were shocked by the murders of the animal - loving divorced mother - of - two and her daughter , who was studying in south wales and was on a weekend visit home .
yesterday a neighbour recalled seeing the suspect in the street at 3am on saturday and also hearing screams coming from the pebble - dashed house .
'i was coming back home at 3am with my girlfriend and i was walking up the back street and he was walking around and i looked at his face and it was like looking into space , there was nothing there , ' he said .
'then i went home and i heard a lot of screams .
it sounded like the screams of a dog .
i went into my backyard and i heard these piercing screams i will never forget . ' .
he did not contact the police , but more noise was heard at around 8am .
'it sounded like someone telling a dog to shut up , ' said the neighbour .
police were called and found the bodies .
jenkin , who is unemployed , spent much of his time on his computer and listening to music .
according to a relative , he had suffered mental health problems for some time .
'he's had a very dark past , but i don't want people to think he is some kind of monster , i just feel sorry for him , ' she said .
the relative said he was sectioned under the mental health act for attempting to slit his wrists and then allowed home again in the days before the tragedy .
she said he had told health workers that he feared he would harm himself or someone else if he did not stay in a secure psychiatric unit .
'john begged people for help , but he didn't get it , ' she said .
friends said john jenkin was close to his family .
one friend , who asked not to be named , said : 'he idolised his mum and his sister .
his little sister was his world , and his mum was too .
they all looked after each other .
he was a good kid , never one of those to go out and get into trouble . ' .
mrs mcmeekin was brought up in millom and was the daughter of a greengrocer .
she moved to merthyr tydfil , south wales , four years ago 'to give her kids a better life' , but returned to her home town with john 12 weeks ago .
she worked for the prison service and 'would do anything for anybody' , according to the friend .
katie , who was in a steady relationship with a boyfriend , stayed in wales to continue her media studies course .
'she was a happy , beautiful girl with the world in front of her , ' said the friend .
she recalled chatting on friday to mrs mcmeekin , who was looking forward to her daughter's visit .
