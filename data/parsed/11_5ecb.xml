voters in reclusive turkmenistan elect a parliament sunday in balloting heralded by authorities in the natural gas-rich nation as a key step toward democratic standards but dismissed by critics as a sham .
the election comes two years after the death of idiosyncratic dictator saparmurat niyazov , which kindled hopes here and in the west that the central asian country would gradually roll back its oppressive political regime and introduce greater freedoms .
niyazov 's successor , president gurbanguli berdymukhamedov , has revoked some of his more draconian decrees and vowed to pursue political reform .
but most of the parliamentary candidates are from the only permitted political party , and exiled opposition activists say the president has failed to live up to his promises .
" beyond all the pompous declarations , there will be no real change , " tadzhigul begmedova , director of the turkmenistan helsinki foundation for human rights , said by telephone from varna , bulgaria .
" the hopes many people had that a new president would open up turkmen society have been shattered . " .
on the surface , turkmenistan 's political landscape is changing .
in september , the rubber-stamp people 's council - a 2,507-member assembly of presidential appointees , town elders and others - voted to abolish itself and cede most of its powers to an expanded parliament .
but out of the 288 candidates running for the 125 seats sunday , more than half are members of the pro-presidential democratic party of turkmenistan - a political force created out of the ashes of the soviet-era turkmen communist party .
non-party candidates have been drawn from state-controlled women 's and veterans ' organizations , trade unions and a youth group .
the only non-party candidate in the capital , ashgabat , avidly supports berdymukhamedov - undermining official claims the polls will offer a wide choice .
" i will devote all my strengths to the honest and righteous support of our esteemed president 's domestic and foreign policy , " the candidate , regional bureaucrat resulberdy mammedov , said in a campaign statement .
niyazov isolated turkmenistan from the international community and forged a pervasive personality cult .
he called himself turkmenbashi , or father of all turkmens , renamed months after himself and his mother , and made his self-penned spiritual tome mandatory reading for students and state employees .
with berdymukhamedov decreasing the country 's isolation , government opponents claim the election is aimed to appease western countries that are eager to win access to its vast natural-gas reserves but wary of its record on democracy and human rights .
the u.s. and european union are seeking to lessen russia 's control over exports of turkmen gas .
" this whole spectacle has been arranged for the international community , to show that turkmenistan is following the path of democratization , " said begmedova .
while officials have extolled the vote as an exercise in democracy , there has been little campaigning and little coverage on state-run television , in contrast with the february 2007 presidential election that confirmed berdymukhamedov 's role as head of state .
" there are very few billboards around the city .
with just four days to go before the election , i still do n't know who i 'm supposed to vote for , " said maral , 45 , an ashgabat resident who declined to give her surname for fear of official intimidation .
