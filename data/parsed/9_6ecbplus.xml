obama administration flips bush endangered species ruling .
04 / 28 / 09 07 : 35 pm et .
federal agencies again will have to consult with government wildlife experts before taking actions that could have an impact on threatened or endangered species .
the obama administration said tuesday it was overturning a rule change made in the final weeks of the bush presidency .
officials at the interior and commerce departments said they have reimposed the consultation requirement that assured the government's top biologists involved in species protection will have a say in federal action that could harm plants , animals and fish that are at risk of extinction .
such consultation had been required for more than two decades until the bush administration made it optional in rules issued last december , just weeks before the change in administrations .
environmentalists argued that the change severely reduced the protection afforded under the federal endangered species act .
"by rolling back this eleventh - hour regulation , we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law" and that top science will be the foundation of the decision making , said interior secretary ken salazar .
commerce secretary gary locke added : "our decision affirms the administration's commitment to using sound science to promote conservation and protect the environment . " .
agencies in the two department's share responsibility for managing and enforcing the endangered species act and employ the government's top scientists in species protection .
in march , president barack obama issued an executive order putting the bush rule change on hold .
congress followed by giving specific authorization for the interior and commerce departments to revoke the action , avoiding a long and complicated regulatory process .
environmentalists widely praised tuesday's action , but some expressed dismay that salazar didn't also rescind a rule that limits the protection to the polar bear , which last year was declared as "threatened" under the endangered species act because of disappearing arctic sea ice as a result of climate change .
the bush administration issued a rule that prohibits an agency from taking into account indirect adverse impacts on the polar bear from activities outside of the arctic region : for example carbon dioxide emissions that are linked to global warming and , therefore , the loss of arctic sea ice .
congress authorized that rule to be revoked as well , but the interior department said no decision had yet been made on the matter .
"from our perspective the job is half done , " said noah greenwald of the center for biological diversity , an advocacy group .
"the polar bear's arctic sea ice habitat is melting away .
if the ( bush ) special rule is not struck down the polar bear is likely to be the first large mammal to go extinct due to global warming in the united states . " .
the end of the long - standing requirement _ dating back to 1986 _ of interagency consultation with the interior and commerce agencies on endangered species protection produced a firestorm in both congress and within the environmental and conservation communities .
for years , agencies involved in thousands of federal activities _ from issuing clean air rules to approving highway or dam construction _ have had to consult not only their own experts but also biologists at the u . s . fish and wildlife service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to ensure the activities did not harm plants , animals or fish that are protected by the endangered species act .
developers and business groups argued that the consultation caused unneeded delays and increased the cost of projects .
the bush administration made the independent consultation optional , arguing that it was a minor shift in policy .
one impetus for the rule change was concern by the bush administration that the endangered species act might be used as a back door to regulate greenhouse gases as a way to combat climate change .
the interior department earlier had declared the polar bear a threatened species because of the loss of arctic sea ice , a change attributed to global warming .
salazar and lock said the two departments will jointly decide if any changes are needed to improve the interagency consultation procedures .
the fish and wildlife service , which is part of the interior department , has jurisdiction over plants and animals , while noaa , part of the commerce department , deals with fish species that are at risk of extinction .
