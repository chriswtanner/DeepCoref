did the earth move for you ?
because it didn't down here at cell block g . dubai experienced a slight "tremor" today , after a more serious earthquake in southern iran , resulting in the evacuation of emirates towers and a few other scrapers .
"witnesses in high - rise buildings said they felt the ground shaking beneath them for about a minute .
many residents evacuated their buildings and waited on the streets . " .
expect endless earthquake experts in the papers tomorrow , such as the prophetic dr azm al homoud .
"we should stop saying the uae is not in an earthquake prone area .
i must say we are near major epicentres across the arabian gulf and fall within the collision area . " .
inmates in the far southern gulags miss out on everything .
cut off by distance , traffic and general lethargy : the forgotten folk in the shadow of the jebel .
