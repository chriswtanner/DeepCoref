and the legitimization of funnybooks continues , as today the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has announced that wolverine himself will be hosting the 81st academy awards , proving once again that he 's the best there is at what he does - even hosting a major awards ceremony !
okay , so it 's a bit of a stretch there , but regardless , today it was announced that one of our own , hugh jackman , will be the host of the ceremony , televised live on sunday , february 22 , 2009 , from the kodak theatre at hollywood and highland center on abc .
while it 's certainly clear that jackman has come into his own as one of hollywood 's top leading men of both stage and screen , what us geeks know him best as is wolverine from both the " x-men " series of films as well as next year 's " x-men origins : wolverine . " .
in a statement released today by the academy , producers had this to say about their choice of jackman as the telecast 's host , " hugh jackman is a consummate entertainer and an internationally renowned movie star .
he also has style , elegance and a sense of occasion .
hugh is the ideal choice to host a celebration of the year 's movies - and to have fun doing it . " .
