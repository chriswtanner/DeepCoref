damaged undersea cables disrupting service .
parts of asia , the middle east , and europe experienced internet and telephone outages friday when three undersea cables between italy and egypt in the mediterranean sea were damaged .
the affected cable systems , which run from alexandria in northern egypt to sicily in southern italy , carry more than 75 percent of traffic between the middle east , europe , and the united states .
it 's still unclear how the cables were damaged or when they will be fixed .
reliance globalcom , a communications provider in india , told bloomberg news that there was no time frame for getting the network fixed .
france telecom said it plans to send a boat to fix the problem and should have service restored to normal by december 31 , according to bloomberg .
the cable system that was cut is known as smw4 cable or south east asia- middle east-western europe 4 .
it connects 12 countries : pakistan , indonesia , singapore , malaysia , bangladesh , india , sri lanka , united arab emirates , saudi arabia , egypt , italy and france .
vodafone 's cell phone service in egypt has been affected by the cable failure , according to bloomberg .
mobile phone service between europe and asia on orange was also disrupted , the bloomberg article said .
orange officials told bloomberg that at one point as much as 55 percent of voice traffic in saudi arabia , 52 percent in egypt , and 82 percent in india was out of service .
telephone providers , such as portugal telecom and reliance , told bloomberg that they 've been rerouting traffic to other parts of their network to avoid issues .
but this rerouting has caused network congestion , which means slower internet connections and some dropped phone calls .
in january , undersea cables outside alexandria were also damaged , disrupting about 70 percent of the communications network in india and the middle east .
