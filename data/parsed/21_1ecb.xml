police arrest suspect in fatal bloomington hit and run .
the driver allegedly hit a 66-year-old woman near a bloomington parking lot and fled the scene .
police said alcohol was a factor .
a woman hit and killed by a motorist wednesday night outside a sam 's club store in bloomington might be alive if the driver had listened to bystanders who frantically pleaded with him to stop .
luann marie johnson , 66 , of burnsville , was walking into the store at 200 w. american blvd. with her husband when she was struck just after 7 p.m. , said sgt. marty earley .
she was in a marked crosswalk when the car hit her .
the impact knocked johnson to the ground .
as she lay in front of the motorist 's vehicle , a man standing next to her screamed , " no , no , no ! " and tried to get the driver to stay put .
instead , the driver gunned the engine and drove over johnson , hitting her and dragging her 10 feet as he sped away , said witness angela benson , who had just exited the store with her two young sons and was 20 feet away .
" it was horrible to see , " said benson , a managing editor at wcco-tv , ch. 4 .
" he took off like a bullet .
people were just screaming . " .
johnson was taken to hennepin county medical center in minneapolis , where she died .
after hitting her , the suspect sideswiped a parked vehicle before leaving the parking lot and heading west on american boulevard .
police stopped anthony phillip lasalle , 36 , of bloomington , when he hit another vehicle at the intersection of american boulevard and lyndale avenue .
they used a taser to subdue him .
lasalle was arrested and booked into the bloomington city jail , earley said .
he is now being held in the hennepin county jail on probable cause for criminal vehicular operation .
police were still gathering statements from several witnesses thursday morning , but " we do know alcohol was a factor , " earley said .
lasalle is expected to be charged today , earley said .
