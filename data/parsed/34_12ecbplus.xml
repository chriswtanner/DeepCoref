former ama trustee dr . benjamin nominated to be surgeon general .
posted july 20 , 2009 .
president obama's choices to be the nation's top physician and top scientist are both hands - on practitioners with extensive leadership experience .
on july 13 , obama announced that he was nominating regina m . benjamin , md , a family physician from southern alabama , to be surgeon general .
dr . benjamin , 52 , became the first woman and first african - american president of the medical assn . of the state of alabama in 2002 .
she also completed a term in june as chair of the ama council on ethical and judicial affairs and served on the ama board of trustees from 1995 to 1998 , becoming the first physician under 40 to serve on the board in a non - resident role .
on july 8 , obama nominated francis s . collins , md , phd , as director of the national institutes of health .
dr . collins , 59 , led the human genome project - - an effort to sequence and map human genes , that concluded in 2003 .
he left his position as director of the nih's national human genome research institute in 2008 after 15 years but maintains a lab at the nih's bethesda , md . , campus .
both nominees must first be confirmed by the senate .
ama president j . james rohack , md , said dr . benjamin has an impressive list of accomplishments , including receiving a macarthur fellowship in 2008 , commonly known as the "genius grant . " .
but awards are not her main focus , he said .
"dr . benjamin's most important qualification for surgeon general is her deep commitment to her patients . " .
dr . benjamin said in the white house rose garden announcement that the deaths of close relatives from preventable diseases drove her to focus on public health .
"my father died with diabetes and hypertension .
my older brother , and only sibling , died at age 44 of hiv - related illness .
my mother died of lung cancer , because as a young girl , she wanted to smoke just like her twin brother could . " .
dr . collins' colleagues said he is a natural choice to head the primary federal agency for funding and conducting medical research because of his thoughtfulness , willingness to listen and experience as a spokesman for the genome mapping effort .
"he's a forceful personality , " said tom murray , phd , head of the hastings center , an independent bioethics research institute .
"he wants to hear from people who don't agree with him . " .
patients before profits .
if confirmed , dr . benjamin would be the nation's lead public health educator .
fellow physicians see the role as a good fit .
besides experience with family illnesses , dr . benjamin said she also was influenced by her medical school training under david satcher , md , phd , who later became surgeon general , and others who focused on public health issues in underserved areas .
jorge alsip , md , the alabama medical society's president , said dr . benjamin has seen how much patients in poor and rural areas appreciate her help .
"that can't help but affect you and make you want to do something for these people , " said dr . alsip , an emergency physician who has known dr . benjamin for more than 15 years .
dr . alsip also said dr . benjamin is tenacious .
"if regina's in a fight , don't ever bet against her . " .
she rebuilt her clinic in bayou la batre , ala . , twice after hurricanes destroyed it and is rebuilding it a third time after a fire .
obama said his surgeon general pick has personally witnessed how the u . s . health system is broken .
"she's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive . " .
dr . benjamin lamented the difficulty some doctors face in caring for patients , regardless of ability to pay .
"it shouldn't be this expensive for americans to get health care in this country , " she said .
obama said dr . benjamin has forgone a salary when her clinic faced financial hardship .
jeff terry , md , chair of the ama's alabama delegation and a urologist , said dr . benjamin has proven herself through work in organized medicine and elsewhere .
the two co - founded the young physicians section of the state medical society nearly two decades ago .
since then , she has held leadership positions in physician organizations and other groups .
dr . benjamin is also probably more politically liberal than many physicians on alabama's gulf coast , dr . terry said .
"maybe president obama saw a little of that in her . " .
both scientific and religious .
obama lauded dr . collins' experience in the july 8 announcement .
"dr . collins is one of the top scientists in the world , and his groundbreaking work has changed the very ways we consider our health and examine disease . " .
dr . collins' laboratory discovered several important genes , including those responsible for cystic fibrosis and huntington's disease .
acquaintances and colleagues predicted that dr . collins would do a good job representing nih in front of lawmakers and others .
he is a very approachable person who doesn't rely on jargon to communicate , said sean b . tipton , spokesman for the american society of reproductive medicine .
"he has an ability to interact with the public and with policymakers and the press that i think will serve him very well as an nih director . " .
the hastings center's murray said that if dr . collins ever made a mistake , it may be that he was a bit overly enthusiastic when describing the potential for breakthroughs when he was leading the human genome project .
still , "i can't fault the scientist who really believes in their work for being enthusiastic as they talk to congress , " murray said .
dr . collins has garnered attention by professing that his belief in god can coexist with his pursuit of science .
he's written books on the topic , including the 2007 best - seller the language of god : a scientist presents evidence for belief .
he is also founder and president of the biologos foundation , whose purpose is to find compatibility between the scientific and religious searches for truth .
in an interview with the spiritual web site beliefnet in 2007 , dr . collins said christians who reject scientific evolutionary theory are also rejecting humans' ability to understand , a god - given skill .
but there are limits to the questions science can answer , such as why we are here or what happens after death , he said .
william hurlbut , md , a consulting professor of neuroscience at stanford university and a former member of president george w . bush's council on bioethics , said the idea that science and religion can't coexist is ridiculous .
"a person with francis' background is a very wise choice" for nih chief , he said .
