obama administration overturns rule that weakened endangered species act .
april 28 , 2009 .
interior secretary ken salazar announced today that the obama administration will reverse an endangered species act ( esa ) regulation that allowed federal agencies to go ahead with actions that may impact endangered species without consulting with experts , essentially circumventing the role of conservation scientists in such decisions .
"by rolling back this eleventh - hour regulation , we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law" said salazar .
the change to the esa was made last december by the bush administration and drew heavy criticism from environmental and conservation groups .
at the time , during heavy campaigning , obama stated that he opposed the last minute rule changes with a spokesman stating : " as president , senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush . " .
darin schroeder , vice president for conservation advocacy at the environmental organization , american bird conservancy , agreed with salazar " s decision .
" we are gratified secretary salazar and secretary locke acted to restore the endangered species act to its intended strength .
the consultation process is one of the cornerstones of the esa , and one of the key checks and balances that ensures protection for the 90 birds and 1 , 263 other animals and plants it covers . " .
another anticipated ruling regarding polar bears has not been announced yet .
while the bush administration found that melting ice in the arctic due to climate change was endangering polar bears , they ruled that the esa could not used to regulate carbon emissions in order to protect the polar bear .
salazar must make a judgment on this rule by may 9th .
" secretary salazar took an important step today toward restoring needed protections for endangered species , " said noah greenwald , biodiversity program director for the center for biological diversity .
" but he still needs to rescind the special rule for the polar bear , which amounts to a death sentence for the majestic bear because it exempts greenhouse gas emissions from regulation . " .
