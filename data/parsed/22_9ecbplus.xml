murder trial ordered for woman accused in kraft plant shootings .
posted : december 08 , 2010 .
yvonne hiller was certain she was being targeted for surreptitious "chemical abuse , " but no one believed her story .
she accused her coworkers of spraying her with deer urine , prompting her to complain to a federal safety agency .
she thought her lawncrest neighbors were running a meth lab , and she called police to her apartment numerous times "for the smell . " .
she believed that chemicals were ruining her health , and had visited several doctors and counselors since 2007 .
despite all that , she couldn't find the source of the toxins she thought were plaguing her .
hiller told homicide detectives that her mounting frustration finally culminated in september , when she went on a shooting rampage through the kraft foods plant in northeast philadelphia , where she had worked for 15 years .
in her statement , hiller admitted killing two coworkers and seriously wounding a third .
homicide detective dominic mangoni , testifying tuesday at hiller's preliminary hearing , said he asked how she felt just hours after the shootings .
"i don't feel anything , " she said , according to the statement .
"i just wish people would accept me for what i was . " .
after the hearing , hiller , 43 , was ordered held on multiple counts of murder , attempted murder , and other crimes .
an arraignment was scheduled for this month .
the defense did not call any witnesses .
hiller entered the courtroom wearing a black garment and black head scarf .
she waved and winked at a clutch of family members in the gallery .
the other side of the room was packed with family members of the victims - latonya brown , 36 , and tanya wilson , 47 , both of whom died in the third - floor break room where they were shot .
the third victim , bryant dalton , 39 , spent two weeks in the hospital and is recovering from gunshots to the neck and shoulder , prosecutors said .
after the hearing , dorothy brown said she was "heartbroken" over the death of her granddaughter , who had four children .
"she left them children , " she said , breaking into tears .
"she was a beautiful person , too . " .
stephen devine , a civil attorney for the brown family , said relatives would hold a vigil thursday at their home at 11th and poplar streets to mark the three - month anniversary of the shooting .
wilson's family and dalton also are represented by civil attorneys , but devine said it was too soon to say if they would file a lawsuit .
at the preliminary hearing , the families "heard for the first time some answers to questions they had since the tragic events occurred , " devine said .
hiller worked with the three victims in the mixing department at the plant at roosevelt boulevard and byberry road .
kraft makes ritz crackers , lorna doone cookies , and other baked goods there .
on the night of the shooting , hiller again confronted her coworkers about her belief that they were spraying her with deer scent .
"they told me they didn't know what i was talking about , " hiller said in her statement .
"i told them , 'you think this is a prank , but you don't know what this was doing to my body . ' " .
after the confrontation , hiller was suspended from her job for the second time in two months .
the other suspension came after she left a voice mail on her supervisor's phone , complaining about being sprayed .
hiller was escorted from the property .
she told detectives that she "planned on going right home . " .
"but then i started to think about the 15 years i spent there and how it was taken away from me , " she said in her statement .
she returned with a . 357 magnum that she legally owned and kept under the seat of her car .
she pointed the gun at two unarmed security guards and ordered them to let her back in the building .
she said she sought out the three coworkers from her shift and opened fire .
hiller admitted firing at several other employees , but denied shooting at the first officers who responded to the scene .
but officer michael murphy , from the seventh district , testified that hiller fired at him and two other officers from down a hallway .
the bullet , he said , went over his left shoulder and hit the wall behind him .
after shutting herself in a quality control room on the second floor , hiller made a number of phone calls to relatives and police .
a 911 supervisor persuaded her to surrender to swat officers on the scene .
