bettie page , the 1950s pin-up model who helped set the stage for the 1960s sexual revolution , has died .
she was 85 .
her agent , mark roesler , said page died yesterday at a los angeles hospital after suffering a heart attack on december 2 .
she never regained consciousness .
page , who became religious and suffered depression in later life , spending years in a mental institution , inspired the 2005 film the notorious bettie page .
she became a cult figure for magazine photographs of her bikinis and see-through lingerie , which were tacked on walls across the us .
after resurfacing in the 1990s , she occasionally granted interviews but refused to allow her picture to be taken .
" i do n't want to be photographed in my old age , " she said in 1998 .
" i feel the same way with old movie stars ... .
it makes me sad .
we want to remember them when they were young . " .
her photos included a centrefold in the january 1955 issue of the then fledgling playboy magazine , as well as controversial sadomasochistic poses .
the latter helped contribute to her mysterious disappearance from the public eye , which lasted for decades and included years during which she battled mental illness and became a born-again christian .
playboy founder hugh hefner said .
" she was a remarkable lady , an iconic figure in pop culture who influenced sexuality , taste in fashion , someone who had a tremendous impact on our society .
she was a very dear person . " .
roesler said page had been in hospital for three weeks with pneumonia and was about to be released when she suffered the heart attack on december 2 .
her career began in october 1950 when she took a break from her job as a secretary in a new york office to take a walk along the beach at coney island .
an amateur photographer named jerry tibbs admired the 27-year-old 's firm , curvy body and asked her to pose .
looking back on the career that followed , she told playboy in 1998 .
" i never thought it was shameful .
i felt normal .
it 's just that it was much better than pounding a typewriter eight hours a day . " .
nudity did n't bother her , she said , explaining .
" god approves of nudity .
adam and eve in the garden of eden , they were naked as jaybirds . " .
they cut her hair into the dark bangs that became her signature and posed her in spiked heels and little else .
she was photographed with a whip in her hand , and in one session she was spreadeagled between two trees , her feet dangling .
" i thought my arms and legs would come out of their sockets , " she said later .
moralists denounced the photos as perversion , and senator estes kefauver of tennessee , page 's home state , launched a congressional investigation .
page quickly retreated from public view , later saying she was hounded by federal agents who waved her nude photos in her face .
and she said she believed that , at 34 , her days as " the girl with the perfect figure " were nearly over .
she moved to florida in 1957 and married a much younger man , after an early marriage to her high school sweetheart had ended in divorce .
her second marriage also failed , as did a third , and she suffered a nervous breakdown .
born on april 22 , 1923 , in nashville , tennessee , page said she grew up in a family so poor " we were lucky to get an orange in our christmas stockings " .
