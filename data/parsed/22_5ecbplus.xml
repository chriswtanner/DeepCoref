yvonne hiller , accused in kraft shooting , is a muslim .
september 10 , 2010 .
yvonne hiller , who has been arrested and charged with the kraft shooting of her co - workers at kraft foods yesterday evening has been revealed to be a muslim who was very spiritual .
at this point it is unclear if the shooting had anything to do with the approaching anniversary of the 9 - 11 attacks on america by radical members of the muslim faith .
however it does seem odd that hiller had a . 357 magnum in her car , which is what she used .
that " s a pretty heavy - duty gun .
nbc philadelphia has interviewed another co - worker of hers , kenneth dorsey , and he said he had talked with her about her muslim faith and even wished her happy ramadan .
