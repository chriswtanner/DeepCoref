it 's a tough job hosting the academy awards .
it 's supposed to be entertaining , but it 's also a night for the stars to revel in the glory of an oscar win .
and the host has to be edgy and funny , without going over the line and insulting the honorees .
but when it works , as it did in 1992 when tough-guy actor jack palance did push-ups in front of comedian and host billy crystal , only to become the butt of crystal 's jokes for the rest of the night , it makes for memorable moments .
on friday , the organization behind the academy awards named australian actor hugh jackman as the host of february 's annual show .
jackman is the first non-comedian to single-handedly host the show in recent years .
the last time an australian hosted the show was in 1987 , when to " crocodile dundee " star paul hogan shared the stage with actress goldie hawn and comedian chevy chase .
coming off starring in " australia , " which has had only limited box office success since its nov. 26 opening with a total box office take of $ 43 million , jackman will rely on song and dance instead of just jokes to entertain a worldwide audience on oscar night .
he has done well hosting the tony awards , the broadway version of the oscars , but the oscars ' audience is used to comedians on the show .
on a night where hype and pomp rule , the comedian 's role is often to keep the show grounded by injecting a jester 's dose of realism .
jackman 's naming as host prompted a " love it or hate it " reaction here on our news floor in los angeles .
there did n't seem to be much in between , so we thought we 'd leave it to readers to weigh in with their own thoughts .
hugh jackman : an oscar hit or miss ?
