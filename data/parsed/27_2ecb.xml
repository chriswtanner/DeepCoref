microsoft patches ie , but security issues remain .
as usual , the bad guys are ahead in the tug-of-war over security .
microsoft today released a patch for the latest internet explorer ( ie ) browser vulnerability that has been in the news since last week .
however , malware authors have already begun pushing out customized variants of the flaw that the microsoft patch may not address .
the vulnerability , rooted in ie 's xml parser , lets attackers execute code on their victims ' pcs .
by saturday , at least 6,000 web sites had been infected and the number is growing though ascertaining the exact number is difficult .
however , security experts say things will get much worse , even if users follow microsoft 's ( nasdaq : msft ) advice to install the patch immediately .
currently attacks have only targeted ie 7 , christopher budd , security response communications lead at microsoft , said in a statement .
they have not been successful against systems where the patch has been applied , according to budd .
microsoft is hosting two webcasts to address customer questions about the security bulletin .
the first was set for 1 p.m. pdt today and 11 a.m. pdt tomorrow in the u.s. and canada .
the webcast will be available on demand after that .
according to researcher rahul mohandas on the mcafee ( nyse : mfe ) avert labs blog , malware authors have already begun issuing customized version of the ie exploit with various degrees of stealth .
one of the most prominent techniques is where the attacker sends victims a microsoft word document by e-mail that contains an embedded activex control triggered when the document is opened .
this exploit was listed as one of the sysadmin , audit , network , security ( sans ) institute 's top 20 security risks in 2007 .
victims of the latest exploit are hit by drive-by injection attacks , where they go to a compromised web site that automatically downloads malicious code onto their web site .
malware authors have come up with a new twist on this , dave marcus , security research and communications director at mcafee labs , told internetnews.com .
they plant an iframe onto a legitimate site and the iframe redirects unsuspecting visitors to the site hosting the malicious code .
an iframe is an html element that lets users embed an html document inside another html document .
the cbs ( nyse : cbs ) tv network site was hit by an iframe attack on november 11 that saw visitors redirected to a server in russia , according to security company finjan 's mcrc blog on november 27 .
" we 've seen an awful lot of sites that have been compromised with the iframe on them , " marcus said .
" it 's a very web 2.0 way of spreading malware . " .
