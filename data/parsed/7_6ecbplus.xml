klitschko stops thompson in regulation win .
july 7 , 2012 .
wladimir klitschko retained his ibf , wbo , wba & ibo heavyweight world titles with a second professional victory over tony thompson on saturday .
klitschko , 36 , stopped the 40 - year - old thompson with two seconds remaining of the sixth round in switzerland to retain his collection of titles .
in 2008 , last time the pair met , the bout went 11 rounds before the ukrainian emerged triumphant .
klitschko dumped thompson onto the canvas with a booming right end towards the end of the fifth round of the fight in bern , and from then on it was simply a matter of time before referee sam williams stopped matters .
the decisive moment came at the end of the next three - minute stretch , the same punch again bringing thompson to his knees and - despite beating the count - he was clearly too unsteady to continue .
klitschko , who could face tyson fury in the near future after being called out by the british - irish fighter , improves to a career record of 58 wins and three defeats .
