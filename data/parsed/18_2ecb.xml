a 61-year-old vancouver man was charged yesterday in connection with the fatal shooting of his former boss at an office christmas party .
eric allen kirkpatrick faces one count of first-degree murder , vancouver police said .

the victim , benjamin david banky , 40 , of vancouver was gunned down friday when a man showed up at the christmas party with a gun .
the man " had a firearm with him .
he shot one man fatally right away , " said vancouver police spokesperson tim fanning .
the business where the shooting occurred is listed as tallgrass distribution ltd. , a natural health product supplier .
kirkpatrick was let go by his employer last thursday , fanning said , but he did not know how long the suspect had worked at the business .
the other people at the office party were able to escape without injury , fanning said .
" the shock was tremendous , but all the other people in the business - and there were another dozen other people who were there for a christmas party - managed to get out safely , " fanning said .

luke pigeon , who lives in an apartment next door , said he did n't hear a gunshot but saw a woman fleeing the building next door .
" all i saw was a ... lady running down the block screaming , " pigeon said .
he said she ran into a nearby auto repair shop where she apparently called for help .
police were on the scene within minutes .
