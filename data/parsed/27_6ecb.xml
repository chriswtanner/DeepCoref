microsoft patches major ie bug .
in record time , microsoft released today an " out of band " patch for a significant security flaw in internet explorer that burst onto the scene 8 days ago .
we strongly recommend that all windows users , especially windows xp and windows 2000 users , apply the patch as soon as possible .
it is available on windows update and through automatic updates and by direct download through the security advisory for the vulnerability .
here is the description of the vulnerability that it presents .
a remote code execution vulnerability exists as an invalid pointer reference in the data binding function of internet explorer .
when data binding is enabled ( which is the default state ) , it is possible under certain conditions for an object to be released without updating the array length , leaving the potential to access the deleted object 's memory space .
this can cause internet explorer to exit unexpectedly , in a state that is exploitable .
that 's not quite enough to help you to write an exploit , but it 's a lot more detail than they usually release .
once again , run , do n't walk , to your vulnerable pcs and apply these updates .
