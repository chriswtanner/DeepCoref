for me the new , unibody macbook pro 17-inch ( pn mb604ll/a ) is probably the most exciting thing announced here at macworld expo .
not only because i 'm more of a hardware guy but also because i 'm a macbook freak .
so , where to start ?
the mbp has three compelling new features .
the new mbp17 has a matte screen option .
can i get a hallelujah ? !
i 've been a staunch critic of glossy displays in macbooks , and i 'm not the only one .
it appears that cupertino is finally listening .
the unibody macbook pro 17 is the first in the new form-factor macbooks to offer a configuration with a matte screen apple calls " antiglare . " .
it 's a $ 50 option though , which is a bit of a slap in the face .
if i 'm spending $ 2,800 on a notebook computer you 'd think that apple would throw in the matte screen option .
but at least it 's available , which is excellent .
the question that remains is if the matte screen option will trickle down to the mbp15 and even the mb13 .
representatives in the apple booth did n't know the answer when i asked them today .
the new mbp17 can support up to 8gb of maximum ram ( and has 4gb standard ) which is a huge step in the right direction .
if you can get past the 8gb $ 1,200 sticker price , that is .
i 'm sure that the ram price is so high because the new 17 ships with two , 2gb 1066mhz ddr3 sdram modules and both have to be removed and replaced with two , 4gb modules to get to 8gb .
prices will eventually come down and 8gb is an attractive option for memory hungry applications and anything to do with virtualization .
the mbp17 's fixed battery is a bit of a scandal .
it 's as if apple did n't learn its lesson with the macbook air and iphone batteries .
after watching the video by the battery engineers during today 's keynote , i 'm partially convinced .
their justification is that fixed batteries save a lot of room previously occupied by connectors , latches and doors .
a fixed battery can use more internal real estate in the enclosure to store power - goes the refrain. as a result the mbp17 fixed battery holds 40 percent more energy and will last up to 8 hours on a charge ( 7 hours when using the faster nvidia 9600m gt chip ) according to apple .
i 'm curious about the real-world run times though .
most companies base their battery benchmarks on perfect world conditions and it will be interesting to see how long the new battery really lasts .
the third usb port is a welcome addition but it comes at the expense of a dedicated fw400 port on the previous model .
solid state drives ( ssds ) are now available as 128mb ( + $ 500 ) and 256mb ( + $ 900 ) options .
in case you 're wondering , a maxed out mbp17 configuration ( 2.93ghz , 8gb , 256gb ssd and anti-glare ) will set you back $ 5,250 .
start saving your nickels and dimes , kids .
i 'm going to wait and see if the anti-glare screen trickles down to the mbp 15-inch before diving in , although the 8gb of ram is attractive .
