south africa : p2p control helps overcome undersea cable outage .
"the seacom undersea cable , which provides a data link between south africa , europe and india , experienced downtime beginning on saturday 8 october 2011 , caused by a problem on a cable between abu talat ( egypt ) and marseilles ( france ) . .
meanwhile , local internet service providers ( isps ) who use bandwidth on the seacom cable have been scrambling to implement contingency plans to keep their customers connected" .
according to an mweb update - "some more bandwidth was brought online last night [ 10 october 2011 ] bringing us up to 83% of our required capacity .
we allowed p2p traffic to run from midnight to 7am , after which it had to give way for critical traffic again . " .
as mweb also uses peerapp's caching solution , it may help serve some p2p traffic without accessing the undersea cable .
