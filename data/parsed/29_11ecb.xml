manning picks apart jaguars .
peyton manning was nearly perfect , exactly what the indianapolis colts needed to overcome all the emotion the jacksonville jaguars got from richard collier 's return .
manning completed his first 17 passes , picked apart jacksonville 's secondary and led the colts to their eighth consecutive win and seventh straight playoff berth .
manning threw for 364 yards and three touchdowns , and the visiting colts secured the no. 5 seed in the afc playoffs with a 31-24 victory over the jaguars on thursday night .
they won without receiver marvin harrison ( hamstring ) , running back joseph addai ( shoulder ) and linebacker gary brackett ( leg ) .
the jaguars ( 5-10 ) lost for the seventh time in the past nine games and fell to 2-6 at home this season .
this one may have been more emotionally draining than any of the others .
collier , a 6-foot-7 offensive linemen paralyzed from the waist down following a shooting in early september , returned to the field for the first time and was recognized during pregame ceremonies .
he drove onto the field , sat next to his teammates during the national anthem and then headed to midfield as an honorary team captain for the coin toss .
" it 's a bittersweet moment , " collier said .
" i 'm here now , but i 'm not a player anymore .
but it 's also great with all the love that 's been shown from everybody .
it was like i 'm back at home .
everybody showed me love .
it was good . " .
