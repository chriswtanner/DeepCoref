mannheim , germany ( sports network ) - wladimir klitschko retained three heavyweight title belts by scoring a dominant seventh-round technical knockout of hasim rahman saturday night .
the 32-year-old klitschko ( 52-3 , 46 kos ) won his 10th consecutive bout by flooring rahman ( 45-7-2 ) once before referee tony weeks stopped the fight 44 seconds into the seventh round .
in a fight that was one-sided from the start , klitschko retained his ibf , wbo and ibo versions of the heavyweight crown .
klitschko , who was coming off an 11th-round knockout of tony thompson in july , landed 178 punches to just 30 for rahman .
klitschko used his jab to his advantage , scoring consistently , and by the sixth round the 36-year-old rahman , a former heavyweight champion , looked tired and clearly beaten .
in the sixth klitschko landed a pair of left hooks to floor an off-balanced rahman , who spent most of his time during the round on the ropes .
in fact , klitschko landed 28 of his 68 punches thrown during the round , while rahman connected on just 1-of-16 over those three minutes .
with rahman getting pounded in the corner early in the seventh , weeks called a halt to the fight .
klitschko 's ukrainian brother , vitali , is the current wbc heavyweight champion , but the siblings have ruled out fighting each other .
wladimir klitschko has held at least one major heavyweight belt since beating chris byrd for the ibf version in april 2006 .
on the undercard , former heavyweight champion riddick bowe ( 43-1 ) scored an eighth-round unanimous decision over gene pukall ( 14-13-2 ) .
the 41-year-old bowe was fighting for the first time since 2005 and stepped into the ring for a professional bout for only the third time since 1996 .
bowe is most remembered for his three fights with evander holyfield and two tough bouts with andrew golota .
