employees at a vancouver wholesaler were coping saturday with the death of their boss , who was gunned down at their office christmas party .
a man facing murder charges in a christmas party shooting was on suicide watch monday as friends and family of paid glowing tribute to his alleged victim .
those who knew benjamin david banky , 40 , were still in shock three days after he was gunned down during what was supposed to be a christmas celebration at his office .
his accused killer , eric kirkpatrick , made a brief appearance in vancouver provincial court monday on a charge of first-degree murder .
banky was ceo of tallgrass distribution ltd. , a wholesaler of natural health products , which remained closed monday .
" he was incredibly bright , a very caring person and incredibly family-oriented , " said nancy o'higgins , a longtime family friend .
o'higgins and her husband eric , both retired journalists , knew ben as a baby because they worked in the media in ontario with ben 's father jake before both families moved west , six months apart .
the o'higgins ' attended ben 's wedding a couple of years ago on hornby island , one of the gulf islands where his parents now live .
" they were n't married very long , just a couple of years . " .
she said ben and his wife grew up as neighbours on hornby island .
" that was how ben and linda knew each other . " .
ben attended school in his early years in white rock but got most of his education in victoria where his father worked for broadcast news , which is now the canadian press .
she said he travelled to china for awhile , where he studied mandarin and was quite fluent .
" i was so incredibly impressed that he spoke mandarin that that really stuck in my head , " said o'higgins .
john banky , ben 's older brother , spoke briefly from the parents ' home monday , alluding to his brother 's musical abilities .
" he spoke a few languages and could play any instrument made by man , " said his brother .
while the family tried to deal with the loss , kirkpatrick made a brief appearance in court .
his lawyer , richard fowler , told the court his client is on suicide watch at the north fraser pretrial centre in port coquitlam .
fowler described conditions at the centre as unacceptable , saying his client is double-bunked with a man who is withdrawing from a drug addiction and the cell is cold .
much of b.c. is in the grips of a cold spell , with unusually cold temperatures in the vancouver area that are well below freezing .
kirkpatrick , who has long grey hair flowing down to his shoulders and a long grey beard , was dressed in red , prison-issue coveralls .
he stood quietly in the prisoner 's box listening to the proceedings .
the sixty-one-year-old was arrested friday , not long after banky was shot to death .
outside court , fowler said kirkpatrick is " not doing very well . " .
" he is placed in a double bunk with somebody who is withdrawing from drugs .
he can not sleep .
it 's freezing cold .
the problem is that these institutions are too full . " .
" he 's presumed innocent and he should be treated better . " .
lon wood , another retired victoria journalist who knew ben 's father from their days working in victoria , said he met ben and the other children through their parents .
" they are a very close family . " .
john paul fraser of national public relations , which is working for tallgrass , said the family is not speaking publicly yet .
at a weekend news conference , city police spokesman const .
tim fanning said kirkpatrick had been let go from tallgrass on thursday .
fanning did n't know how long the suspect had worked at the business .
the other people at the office party were able to escape without injury , fanning said .
" the shock was tremendous but all the other people in the business - and a dozen other people who were there for a christmas party - managed to get out safely , " fanning said .
the shocked party-goers were put on buses and taken to police headquarters where witness statements were taken , he said .
he said counsellors have been made available to them .
