interior , commerce departments overturn rule that cut science out of endangered species act .
statement by francesca grifo .
today , interior secretary ken salazar rescinded eleventh - hour bush administration changes to endangered species act regulations that allowed federal agencies to decide for themselves if their own projects--such as roads and dams--would threaten imperiled species .
federal agencies again will be required to consult with expert biologists at the u . s . fish and wildlife service or national marine fisheries service before undertaking or permitting new projects .
the rule change was just one of several controversial bush administration actions that undermined the scientific foundation of the endangered species act , according to the union of concerned scientists ( ucs ) .
in a related story , 1 , 300 biologists and three scientific societies representing some 20 , 000 scientists sent separate letters last friday to the interior and commerce departments urging them to overturn the last - minute bush rule changes .
below is a statement by francesca grifo , director of ucs's scientific integrity program .
"several last - minute bush administration regulatory changes have undermined the scientific foundation of the endangered species act , and today the obama administration has begun to repair the damage .
the message from tens of thousands of scientists around the country is clear : these unwarranted changes fundamentally undermine our ability to protect imperiled plants and animals .
"today , the obama administration restored critical checks and balances to protect our nation's biodiversity .
interior secretary salazar's decision is a long - awaited first step .
but there is much more to be done .
the obama administration must thoroughly review how science is used to ensure that our nation's imperiled species have a chance to survive--and thrive . " .
