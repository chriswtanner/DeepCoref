seventeen hours after the attack on one of his schools killed 40 palestinians seeking shelter from israel 's war on hamas , the united nations ' director of operations in gaza , john ging , was certain of at least one thing " we have established beyond any doubt that the school was not being used by any militants , " mr ging told the age last night .
" they were innocent people . " .
speaking by phone from the un 's relief and works agency in gaza , mr ging struggled to contain his anger at the attack that has also left more 50 people with serious injuries , 10 of whom remain critical .
israel has demanded that hamas be prevented from rearming as a main condition for a ceasefire .
when the israeli attack came on the prep c girls school in the jabaliya camp at 3.45pm on tuesday , mr ging said about 350 palestinians were inside , using the school as a shelter .
" the reason they were in the school is because the israelis had told them to go there , " he said .
" they were doing exactly as they had been told . " .
to ensure there was no confusion about the school 's location , mr ging said the united nations gave specific gps co-ordinates to israeli defence forces commanders .
but after receiving reports that mortar shells had been fired at israeli units from within the school grounds , the commanders decided to strike back .
" they shot back to save their own lives , " said israeli defence forces spokesman ilan tal .
three tanks shells exploded just outside the school grounds , causing pandemonium inside .
" as you can imagine , this was a very distressing attack , " mr ging said .
" it has killed 40 people , and some of those who were injured may yet die .
" now we need to know how this happened .
a full , transparent and independent inquiry has to be held to determine exactly how this occurred . " .
the israeli defence forces maintained that mortars had been fired from the school .
in a statement released by spokesman captain benjamin rutland , it said it had incontrovertible evidence to support its version of events .
" this is not the first time that hamas has fired mortars and rockets from schools , in such a way deliberately using civilians as human shields in their acts of terror against israel , " the statement said .
brigadier-general avi benayahu said the israeli defence forces had established that hamas terror operatives were among the dead at the school , and had proof of a mortar battery cell that had been firing in the area .
" hamas operatives imad abu askhar and hassan abu askhar were among terrorists that were identified to be killed , " he said .
the attack on the school has caused widespread shock across israel , intensifying pressure on prime minister ehud olmert to reach a ceasefire .
after 13 days of bombardment of gaza from the air , land and sea , which has claimed more than 660 lives , the past few days of fighting have been among the bloodiest in the history of the israel-palestinian conflict .
five israeli soldiers lost their lives on wednesday , four from friendly fire , bringing to 10 the number of israelis who have been killed .
just before midnight on tuesday , three gazans were killed when israeli forces attacked another un school in gaza city .
earlier that day , a shell hit a house in the beach refugee camp , killing at least seven members of one family .
shelling of houses in the bureij refugee camp left at least five dead and 16 injured .
