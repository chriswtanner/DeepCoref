top-ranked north carolina waited for tyler hansbrough to make history , then cruised to its latest lopsided victory .

the reigning national player of the year passed phil ford for the record midway through the first half .

" i never dreamed i 'd be here and be the all-time leading scorer , " hansbrough said as he stood alone at midcourt after the game .
" this is a great honor to be here and to represent you guys every night in this uniform . " .
