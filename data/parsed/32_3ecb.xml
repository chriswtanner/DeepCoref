the new bedford man arrested last night on charges of double homicide killed his mother and ex-girlfriend , according to police and prosecutors .
the suspect , gary gomes , 35 , of new bedford , has a lengthy record of domestic abuse , including convictions for kidnapping and attempted murder .
he was currently on probation after his latest release from criminal custody .
the victims in the case have been identified as robyn mendes , 48 - an ex-girlfriend of mr. gomes - and catherine gomes , 61 , the defendant 's mother .
gregg milliote , spokesman for the bristol county district attorney 's office , said both women were stabbed multiple times at the independent street apartment in which they were found .
ms. gomes was the tenant at the apartment .
following his arraignment in new bedford district court today , mr. gomes was ordered held without bail .
at the arraignment , prosecutor aaron strojny said ms. mendes was stabbed multiple times while in bed .
" i ( heart ) you " was written in blood on the wall and the suspect 's id was found on a pillow , he said , and alleged the suspect later dressed ms. mendes and applied makeup .
ms. gomes ' body was found under a mattress in a different room .
she had last been seen saturday morning , prosecutors said , and when her employer called the apartment later that day to inquire why she had not reported to work , a man who identified himself as gary said his mother had gone away for a few days .
mr. gomes was found tuesday night barricaded in a dwelling on phillips road in the north end where ms. mendes lived .
ms. mendes ' 12-year-old daughter was also in that dwelling at the time .
police say gomes had been at that location for " a few hours " before his arrest .
they found a knife , which they identified as the murder weapon , behind a bookshelf .
mr. milliote said prosecutors believe mr. gomes intended to kill one other person last night , although he would n't say who that person was or what evidence led prosecutors to believe that .
mr. gomes had been released from the bristol county house of correction in late 2008 after serving time on a 2006 conviction of assault with intent to murder .
ms. mendes was the victim in that case .
in 2005 , he was charged with assault and battery on ms. mendes with a dangerous weapon , according to court records , which indicate he grabbed her by the throat , threw her down , then held a knife to her throat and told her , " you 're never going to leave me . " .
he was sentenced to 2 1/2 years , with 9 months to serve in that case .
court records also indicate a previous arrest in which mr. gomes was accused of assault and battery on his sister after she accused him of stealing her guitar .
his mother was a witness to that incident .
ms. mendes had obtained restraining orders against mr. gomes in 2005 and 2006 , according to court records .
the victims ' bodies were discovered inside the independent street apartment tuesday afternoon after the building 's landlord detected the odor of natural gas emanating from the second floor .
police said that after smelling gas , the landlord , who has not been identified , sent his adult son upstairs to investigate .
the son entered the apartment and found the bodies , police said .
the gas stove was running with no flame , police said , and an electric heater had been turned on in the apartment .
