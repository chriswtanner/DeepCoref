with this acquisition , hp aims to bring the two more closely together and help build dynamic computing environments from the start .
"data center transformation is a key focal point for the hp services team , " says john mccain , senior vice president and general manager of hp services .
"power consumption is becoming one of the largest components in terms of the bill in data centers today . " .
to combat the increase in energy spending , hp labs has developed technology to conserve energy and delivers it via such products as hp dynamic smart cooling and hp thermal zone mapping .
the deal , according to eyp mcf representatives , will let consultants expand beyond facilities planning and offer expertise in large - scale data - center design .
"it infrastructure is ready for a major paradigm shift in the way that mission - critical facilities are delivered to the marketplace , " says steve einhorn , chairman of eyp mcf .
"the data center and its facility are ready for a major change . " .
