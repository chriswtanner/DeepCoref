the eastern conference standings have claimed another coach , with philadelphia 76ers head man maurice cheeks joining the ever-growing list of coaches who are no longer employed .
the 2008-09 season was supposed to be a good one for the sixers , who claimed the summer 's top free agent prize in elton brand and then assured that their big three would be together long-term by re-signing anre iguodala .
unfortunately , it has n't played out that way to date .
currently sitting at 9-14 on the season , the only thing stopping philly from being complete buried in the standings is that so many eastern conference teams are struggling , as well .
despite their poor start and their current three-game losing streak - likely to end tonight as the team takes on the wizards - the sixers are still just two games in the loss column behind the eighth seed in the east .
cheeks marks the third eastern conference head coach to get fired this season , following in the footsteps of the toronto raptors ' sam mitchell and the washington wizards ' eddie jordan .
cheeks will be succeeded by assistant gm tony dileo .
