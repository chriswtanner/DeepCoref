video of brooklyn woman's fatal shooting is played at trial of two men charged in rooftop gunplay .
april 12 , 2013 | 4 : 00am .
rapt jurors yesterday watched surveillance video of the chilling moment that a brooklyn mom was fatally struck by stray gunfire and slowly fell over into a pool of her own blood .
the disturbing evidence was made public at the trial of the two men accused of killing zurana horton from a brownsville rooftop in 2011 .
horton , 34 , was walking with one of her 12 children when andrew lopez , 20 , fired from the rooftop on the orders of his brother jonathan carrasquillo , 24 , prosecutors charge .
also shot were a woman named unique armstead , who was walking near horton , and an 11 - year - old girl who was passing by .
yesterday , armstead told jurors at the brooklyn supreme court trial about the moment she was struck in the shooting , which was allegedly sparked by a gangland territorial beef .
"at the time , i thought it was a brick , but it was a bullet , " testified armstead , who was walking with her son and who can be seen in the video stumbling against a building after she is shot .
when prosecutor seth goldman asked whether she shielded her son with her body , armstead quietly answered , "yes . " .
"when me and my son were on the floor , i noticed mrs . horton fall down .
i honestly thought she was shot in the head .
there was blood . " .
armstead also testified that she heard a group of young men arguing about a gun shortly before the shooting , which matches up with prosecutors' claim that carrasquillo ordered lopez to the roof with the gun after a dispute between their 8 block gang and the rival young guns crew .
the talk of guns had made armstead nervous , especially since she was with her young son .
"i speed - walked to my son , and i held him .
i was scared .
i was trying to get out of harm's way , " she testified .
armstead said she sought safety for herself and her son in a store , but when activity on the street seemed to have settled , she walked back outside - where a bullet went straight through her arm and she saw horton killed .
brooklyn supreme court judge vincent del giudice briefly sealed the courtroom at the request of prosecutors because their next witness had been threatened with death by the alleged shooter's brother .
the fearful witness had entered the courtroom with hood over his head , del giudice said when the courtroom was reopened .
"the man is an emotional wreck , " the judge said before postponing the man's testimony until monday .
