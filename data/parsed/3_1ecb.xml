after more than three years and a tangled trail of frustrating legal delays , the man who killed four people in a brazen courthouse escape was sentenced saturday to prison for life without parole and hundreds of years more .
yet prosecutors who spent the last month urging jurors to sentence one of atlanta 's most notorious criminals to death were not celebrating .
" the community has spoken , " fulton county district attorney paul howard said at an emotional press conference after the sentencing of brian nichols .
" even though we are puzzled and terribly disappointed by the decision , we must accept the conclusion provided by our community . " .
it showed how difficult it is to get a capital sentence in atlanta 's fulton county , where death penalties are rare even in a state where support for capital punishment is widespread .
georgia tied for third in carrying out executions last year .
and it underscored the problems georgia prosecutors say they frequently face with the requirement that death sentences can only be returned by unanimous jury verdicts .
nichols , 37 , was found guilty last month of murdering a judge , a court reporter , a sheriff 's deputy and a federal agent in the march 2005 rampage .
after four days deliberating on whether to recommend the death penalty , the jury deadlocked at 9-3 .
nichols will likely die in prison after superior court judge james bodiford handed down the maximum prison sentence on each of 54 charges .
the deadlock devastated prosecutors , who had turned down an offer from nichols ' attorneys to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence .
the trial has already cost more than $ 2 million , likely the most expensive in state history .
and it may not be over yet .
howard said he 's talked to the u.s. attorney about a federal death penalty trial for the federal agent 's slaying .
in the meantime , howard and some state legislative leaders said georgia 's death penalty rules should be changed .
" georgia is a conservative state , but there are pockets where it is not , " said state rep. barry fleming , a republican who led a failed bid last year to allow judges to approve death penalties even if one or two jurors voted against it .
" there are people who will attempt to nullify the law when they get on the jury . " .
the last time a fulton county jury issued a death sentence was eight years ago , and only then for a triple murderer who killed a toddler .
one factor could be race .
the county is 43 percent black , and numerous polls and surveys have found that blacks are more likely than whites to oppose capital punishment .
eight of the jurors were black .
the three who voted against the death penalty would not comment , but howard said other jurors told him the three holdouts refused to deliberate .
he said he was told that one was wearing headphones during the closed-door discussions this week .
two jurors who spoke at howard 's news conference but declined to be identified said they worked hard to try to reach a verdict .
" i believe brian nichols did not win .
in his own words , he said it 's not his dna to stay in jail , which is what he has to look forward to the rest of his life , " said christina greenway , daughter of slain court reporter julie ann brandau .
" i 'm not disappointed and i have no regrets . " .
nichols was being escorted to his trial for rape when he overpowered a deputy guarding him and stole her gun .
he burst into the courtroom and shot and killed superior court judge rowland barnes , brandau and sheriff 's deputy hoyt teasley .
he fled downtown atlanta and managed to evade hundreds of police officers searching for him overnight .
in atlanta 's posh buckhead neighborhood , he shot and killed federal agent david wilhelm at a house the agent was renovating .
death penalty experts said the nichols verdict shows there 's no telling what will happen when a jury is asked to settle a capital case .
" it 's very hard for 12 people to sit down around the table to make a decision to put another human being to death , " said stephen bright , a yale law school lecturer and a veteran capital defense attorney .
nichols , who argued he was insane when he carried out the killings , spoke for the first time in court on saturday as relatives of the victims ' families quietly wept .
" i just wanted to say that i know that the things i 've done caused a lot of pain and i 'm sorry , " he said .
" and i just wanted to say that i will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life .
that 's it . " .
the judge had advice for anyone who deals with nichols in the future .
" do not trust mr. nichols ever again .
ever again .
because he can not be trusted . " .
