up the coast . . . the philly sixers canned jim o'brien [ who had been under fire all season ] and quickly hired mo cheeks .
mo ran the sixers in the 1980s as their point guard .
he looks to be a perfect coach for allen iverson .
really , this move has been in the making for quite some time .
the sixers have bugged portland about talking to him about their head coaching job over the past 3 years .
after the blazers fired cheeks . . . it was only a matter of time before philly and cheeks hooked up again .
