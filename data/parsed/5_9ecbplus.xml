samuel dalembert agreed to a six year deal with the philadelphia 76ers on saturday , his agent marc cornstein , told espn . com .
cornstein refused to disclose the amount of the contract , but it's believed to be worth between $60 million to $70 million , based on previous negotiations .
the signing came just one day before dalembert was set to get on a plane and visit the atlanta hawks , who had the money under the cap to pay him a maximum five - year , $70 million offer .
of the three top big men on the market , dalembert was the center with the most upside .
he has great range and is athletic , with great shot blocking instincts .
he's shown he can be a volume rebounder and his offensive game is emerging .
he was very inconsistent at times this season , but in the playoffs against the detroit pistons , he played the part of a franchise center .
the sixers made a power move this offseason , firing head coach jim o'brien , who wasn't a dalembert fan , and replacing him with mo cheeks , who is .
philly let it be known that o'brien was fired , in part , because the sixers are committed to dalembert .
this is the third deal for the sixers this summer .
they also reached six - year deals with kyle korver for $25 million and with willie green for about $20 million .
