hewlett - packard corp . ( nyse : hpq ) has opened up its checkbook once again .
this time , the world's largest tech company by sales announced that it will be buying eyp mission critical facilities inc .
that company , which provides data center consulting services , will become a division of hp for an undisclosed sum , according to sources .
is this a move to compete more headily with tech giant ibm corp . ( nyse : ibm ) ?
it could certainly be seen that way .
hp's growing presence in providing data center services and contract consulting is the core of ibm's business model these days , now that the latter is out of the hardware business .
eyp provides design , technology planning and support for large data centers - - the kind that runs a large u . s . bank , credit card operation or manufacturing business .
this is right in ibm's territory , and the move should put hp in a more competitive position to challenge ibm as a premier provider of computing services consulting .
does hp's mark hurd want to grow the company he leads into the biggest computing hardware and services manufacturing company the world has ever seen ?
in a word , yes .
