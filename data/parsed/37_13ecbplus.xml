at least five people were reportedly injured and 10 houses were damaged in takengon , the capital of central aceh district , said sutopo purwo nugroho of the national disaster mitigation agency .
"i see many houses were damages and their roofs fell onto some people , " said bensu elianita , a 22 year - old resident in bukit sama village in central aceh district .
"many people were injured but it is difficult to evacuate them due to traffic jams . " .
she said many people in the village ran out from their houses in panic and screamed for help .
at least two houses were totally flattened , she said , adding that the quake also caused blackout in the village .
indonesia is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the pacific ring of fire , an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the pacific ocean .
in 2004 , a huge earthquake off aceh triggered a tsunami that killed 230 , 000 people across asia .
