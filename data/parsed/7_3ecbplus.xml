wladimir klitschko stopped tony thompson in the sixth round to keep a comfortable hold on his wba , ibf and wbo heavyweight title belts on saturday in bern , switzerland .
klitschko put thompson on the canvas with a big right hand near the end of the fifth round at stade de suisse , and the 40 - year - old american southpaw never recovered .
the ukrainian champion dropped thompson again in the sixth , and referee sam williams gave the challenger a standing count before stopping the fight at 2 : 56 .
"thompson was not so easy to box .
i'm satisfied , " said the 36 - year - old klitschko , who improved his record to 58 - 3 ( 51 ko ) .
klitschko finished the fight five rounds sooner than when knocking out thompson in the 11th of their first title fight in 2008 .
thompson , who was the mandatory challenger nominated by the ibf , fell to 36 - 3 ( 24 ko ) .
after the fight , klitschko led the 22 , 000 crowd in signing "happy birthday" to his trainer emanuel steward , whose was 68 on saturday .
"tony thompson is very hard to hit , " steward said .
"tony was watching wladimir's right hand all night . " .
a cagey opening round was followed by a scrappy second , as klitschko twice wrestled thompson to the floor .
thompson briefly stepped up his cautious tactics when landing a left to klitschko's face in the third .
klitschko finally landed a long , straight right in the fifth and the round ended with thompson struggling on the ropes .
the champion cornered thompson toward the end of the sixth , and landed punches to the head though no single blow appeared to cause serious damage .
"i got caught but i'm ok , " thompson said in the ring .
"he's strong and he's world heavyweight champion for a reason . " .
klitschko extended the domination of the heavyweight ranks he shares with his elder brother vitali .
vitali was in his brother's corner as usual , and acted as cheerleader in the third round , urging on fans in the football stadium when the first chants of "klitschko , klistchko" stirred .
the elder klitschko will defend his wbc title against manuel charr of germany in moscow on sept . 8 .
