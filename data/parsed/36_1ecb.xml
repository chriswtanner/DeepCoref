2 leaders of polygamist group arrested in canada .
two top leaders of a polygamous community in western canada have been arrested and charged with practicing polygamy , british columbia 's attorney general said wednesday .
attorney general wally oppal said winston blackmore is charged with marrying 20 women , while james oler is accused of marrying two women .
" this has been a very complex issue , " oppal said .
" it 's been with us for well over 20 years . " .
blackmore , long known as " the bishop of bountiful , " runs an independent sect of about 400 members in the town of bountiful .
he once ran the canadian arm of the utah-based fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , but was ejected in 2003 by that group 's leader , warren jeffs .
oler is the bishop of bountiful 's flds community loyal to jeffs .
even though many of the town 's residents are related or have same last name , followers of the two leaders are splintered and are not allowed to talk with each other .
flds members practice polygamy in arranged marriages , a tradition tied to the early theology of the mormon church .
mormons renounced polygamy in 1890 as a condition of utah 's statehood .
last june , oppal appointed a special prosecutor to look into allegations of criminal abuse at bountiful despite two earlier legal opinions that said it would be difficult to proceed with criminal charges for polygamy itself .
blackmore openly acknowledges having numerous wives and dozens of children but has said his community abhors sexual abuse of children .
oppal said some legal experts believe polygamy charges will not withstand a constitutional challenge in canada over the issue of freedom of religion .
" i 've always taken the position that 's a valid offense in law , " oppal said .
" and if someone says that it 's contrary to their religion , let a judge make that decision . " .
the flds , with an estimated 10,000 members , is headquartered in colorado city , ariz. , and hildale , utah .
in 1947 , a small group moved just across the border into lister , british columbia .
the newcomers dubbed the pristine spot at the base of a snowy mountain range bountiful .
besides an estimated 1,000 canadians living in bountiful , the u.s. embassy estimates there are about 300 americans there who are loyal to blackmore and 200 others who follow jeffs , who is in jail awaiting trial in arizona on four counts of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor .
