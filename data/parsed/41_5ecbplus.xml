south sudan accuses sudan of air strike on refugee camp .
thu nov 10 , 2011 3 : 00pm est .
a refugee camp in south sudan's unity state was bombed thursday , south sudan officials and witnesses said , threatening to raise tensions with sudan in the violence - plagued border region .
taban deng , the governor of unity state , accused sudan of carrying out the attack .
"these people ( khartoum ) should be taken to book .
they should adhere to international laws and regulations , " he told reporters in bentiu .
sudan's armed forces denied they carried out the strike .
in a statement before the bombing , south sudan's president salva kiir talked of sudan's "pending invasion" of its neighbor .
violence along the poorly defined border since south sudan's independence in july has strained ties between the two former civil war foes .
they have accused one another of backing rebel groups on their sides of the border .
a reuters correspondent heard a large explosion in the yida refugee camp , then saw a crater about two meters ( 6 . 6 feet ) wide , an unexploded bomb wedged in the side of a school building and a white aircraft flying north .
witnesses said there were three further explosions at 3 p . m . ( 1200 gmt ) .
yida is a camp of about 20 , 000 refugees from the nuba mountains region of south kordofan , a state north of the border where rebels have been fighting sudan's army since june .
khartoum reported fresh clashes in the state thursday .
there were no immediate reports of any casualties at the camp , less than 25 km ( 15 miles ) from the border with sudan .
a spokesman for the enough project , an activist group that works to end genocide , said the group confirmed there were no dead or wounded .
"the refugees need to be safe and need to be protected .
they ran away from war .
they should not be pursued inside the territory of south sudan , " deng , the governor , said .
al - sawarmi khalid , spokesman for sudan's armed forces , said sudan had not bombed anywhere in south sudan's territory .
"south sudan is a state in the united nations .
we respect international law , and it's impossible that we would do that , " he said .
khalid said sudanese forces fought rebels in south kordofan about five kilometers south of the town of taludi thursday , killing dozens and destroying a tank and other military vehicles .
fighting has also broken out in sudan's blue nile state this year .
the two states are home to tens of thousands of fighters who sided with the south during the war but were left in sudan when south sudan seceded , analysts say .
south sudan split off into a separate country in july after voting overwhelmingly for secession in a january referendum , the culmination of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war between north and south .
volatile border .
fire crackled in the dry grass around the crater about 100 meters away from an aid agency compound in yida camp .
"they ( khartoum ) don't want any life in the nuba mountains , and now they are expanding the war to the south sudan republic , " said yousif ismail , a refugee from the nuba mountains , as he stood by the hole .
last week , khartoum submitted its second complaint to the u . n . security council , accusing south sudan of supplying anti - aircraft and anti - tank missiles , ammunition , landmines and mortars to insurgents in south kordofan and blue nile states .
kiir denied those claims in a statement thursday , calling them "smoke screens to mask khartoum's own activities in support of the armed dissident groups that are fighting its proxy war against the republic of south sudan . " .
the accusations were being used to justify sudan's "pending invasion of the south , " kiir said .
the two countries have yet to agree on how much the new nation will pay to use sudan's oil pipelines and other facilities , which south sudan depends on to export crude .
they also dispute control of the abyei region .
some 2 million people died in the north - south civil war , waged for all but a few years since 1955 over religion , ideology , ethnicity and oil .
