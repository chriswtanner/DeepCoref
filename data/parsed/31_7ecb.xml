hansbrough broke unc 's career scoring record the carolina way .
during the spring of 1977 , north carolina coach dean smith invited his star guard phil ford , who had just completed his junior season , into his office .
smith told ford that he had done some research on where ford would be selected in the upcoming nba draft. based on that information , he recommended to ford that he leave school .
ford did n't even have to think about it .
he told smith right away that he was n't interested .
" at the time , a lot of people were n't doing that , so going pro was n't something i had even considered at all , " ford says .
" the financial situation was different back then as well .
at the time , my parents were teachers , so getting my degree was very important to me .
the opportunity was n't worth me not getting my degree . " .
last april , tyler hansbrough faced a similar decision , but under much different circumstances .
hansbrough plays in an era when not only is it common for undergraduates to turn pro , but in some circles a player is considered a failure if he stays past his junior year .
needless to say , he faced a financial opportunity much greater than the one ford confronted three decades ago .
hansbrough spent two full weeks torturing himself over the impending decision .
when hansbrough finally told roy williams he wanted to return for his senior year , he felt like the weight of the world was off his shoulders .
he was so relieved that he did n't even leave the weight room when williams asked him to come to his office so they could craft a press release .
" it was a stressful process , " hansbrough said in mid-october .
" you 're thinking about what you 're going to do with the rest of your life .
every time i thought about leaving , i thought about how much i 'd miss coming home , living with my teammates and doing a lot of the fun things we do .
i just felt like coming back would be the best situation for me . " .
in considering that life decision , it 's doubtful hansbrough gave much thought to the chance he would have to become north carolina 's alltime scoring leader if he returned .
still , given the century 's worth of tradition that has reigned in chapel hill , it was no small feat that hansbrough accomplished thursday night , when he broke ford 's school career scoring mark with less than eight minutes to play in the first half of north carolina 's game against evansville .
north carolina has established itself as the gold standard of college basketball , and in the soft-spoken , hard-charging , 6-foot-9 power forward from poplar bluff , missouri , this proud program has a worthy standard bearer .
ford is correct when he says that people are n't appreciative enough of hansbrough 's skills , but there is no doubt that what sets this young man apart is the intensity with which he plays .
if ford was a classical symphony , hansbrough is a heavy metal rock concert , powering , jostling , banging , and always , always out-hustling his opponent en route to the basket .
it is instructive that while hansbrough remains ninth on the acc 's alltime scoring list , he is already the league 's career leader in free throws attempted .
if he stays healthy , he will likely leave north carolina as the school 's alltime rebounds king .
more than anything , though , tyler hansbrough deserves this record because he came back to school .
this is not to disparage players like michael jordan , antawn jamison and rashad mccants who might have had a shot at ford 's mark had they stayed .
but at a place like north carolina , which embodies team play , the scoring record should belong to a four-year player .
hansbrough would probably not have been a top-five draft pick had he left , but it 's unlikely he will signifcantly improve his draft status by playing another year .
also , at the time hansbrough made his decision he was assuming that at least one of his fellow undergraduates , and as many as three of them , would be turning pro , diminishing the tar heels ' chances of winning a championship .
hansbrough came back anyway , and for all the right reasons .
ford also points out that because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity ball from 1954-73 , a huge swath of mega talents who suited up for unc did n't have the chance to hold onto this record -- including the man ford passed , lenny rosenbluth , who still holds the school 's record for career scoring average ( 26.9 ) and is fourth in points scored .
hansbrough is sixth on the school 's career scoring average list at 20.2 .
still , it takes a special individual to eclipse a record that has stood at a place like north carolina for 30 years .
ford remembers little about the night he passed rosenbluth .
he believes he broke the record late in the first half , the game was not interrupted , and neither he nor rosenbluth had much to say about it .
in fact , rosenbluth was n't even there that night .
when i asked ford if he still has the game ball , he said he thought he might , but he has moved so much in recent years ( he worked as an assistant coach for the detroit pistons and new york knicks before joining the charlotte bobcats last year ) that he thinks the ball may be packed away somewhere .
" to be honest , i was just happy to get it over with , " ford says .
" i did n't want anything distracting from the team . " .
if the circumstances were different than they were in 1978 , the central tenets of the carolina way have endured , from rosenbluth to ford to hansbrough .
while offering his congratulations to hansbrough , ford is quick to add that the career scoring record is the least important mark at north carolina .
" we never cared who scored the ball , " he says , " as long as someone with the carolina jersey got the ball in the basket . " .
tyler hansbrough would be the first to agree , even as he jostles and bangs his way towards history .
