scientific consultations under endangered species act restored .
washington , dc , april 28 , 2009 .
the obama administration today revoked an eleventh - hour bush - era rule that undermined protections for plants and animals listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act .
passed in january 2009 , the bush - era rule lifted the requirement that federal agencies consult wildlife experts with the u . s . fish and wildlife service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration before taking actions that could harm listed species .
the bush move allowed federal agencies to decide for themselves if their own projects , such as roads , dams and mines , would hurt species .
secretary of commerce gary locke and secretary of the interior ken salazar , who head the two agencies that administer the endangered species act , said their decision to again require consultation before action is based on sound science .
"by rolling back this 11th hour regulation , we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law , " salazar said .
"because science must serve as the foundation for decisions we make , federal agencies proposing to take actions that might affect threatened and endangered species will once again have to consult with biologists at the two departments , " he said .
"for decades , the endangered species act has protected threatened species and their habitats , " said locke .
"our decision affirms the administration's commitment to using sound science to promote conservation and protect the environment . " .
in march , president barack obama directed the secretaries to review the previous administration's section 7 regulation of the endangered species act , which governs interagency consultation .
congress , in the 2009 omnibus appropriations act , specifically authorized the secretaries to revoke the regulation .
locke and salazar said the two departments will conduct a joint review of the 1986 consultation regulations that are now once again in effect to determine if any improvements should be proposed .
the endangered species act was signed into law in 1973 to protect imperiled species from extinction , as well as conserve the ecosystems and habitats necessary for their survival .
today there are 1 , 009 species in the united states listed as endangered under the act - 409 animals and 600 plants .
an additional 162 animals and 146 plants are listed as threatened .
environmentalists and scientists who had lobbied against making consultation discretionary were pleased with the decision .
betsy loyless , national audubon society senior vice president for advocacy and policy , said , "the obama administration has given a great gift to wildlife and to future generations .
once again , our nation will follow the letter of the law and the advice of its own best experts before jeopardizing the future of threatened and endangered species . " .
the decision comes as president obama prepares to mark his first 100 days in office on wednesday .
loyless said , "the president has capped his first hundred days with a serious step toward restoring our commitment to this nation's great natural heritage . " .
last friday , 1 , 300 biologists and three scientific societies representing some 20 , 000 scientists - the ornithological council , society for conservation biology and the wildlife society - sent separate letters to the interior and commerce departments urging them to overturn the last - minute bush rule change .
"many federal agencies do not have the scientific expertise to determine the consequences of federal projects on endangered species and may have vested interests in the implementation of a project , " said stuart pimm , doris duke professor of conservation ecology at duke university , who helped organize the scientists' letter .
pimm said the bush rule excluded from the process expert scientists who for decades have provided impartial review and critical analysis of proposed projects .
alan thornhill , an ecologist and executive director of the society for conservation biology , said , "as the threats we face continue to evolve , federal scientists must be able to evaluate their consequences for imperiled species .
putting boundaries on the science that informs the endangered species act fundamentally undermines the ability of science and scientists to protect our nation's biodiversity . " .
"politics plays a huge role in such decisions , " said michael hutchins , executive director and chief executive of the wildlife society .
"expert review and oversight are critical . " .
francesca grifo , director of union of concerned scientists' scientific integrity program , said lifting the requirement for consultation was one of a number of ways the bush administration weakened the act , and more work remains to be done .
"several last - minute bush administration regulatory changes have undermined the scientific foundation of the endangered species act , and today the obama administration has begun to repair the damage , " she said .
"the message from tens of thousands of scientists around the country is clear - these unwarranted changes fundamentally undermine our ability to protect imperiled plants and animals . " .
"today , the obama administration restored critical checks and balances to protect our nation's biodiversity , " said grifo .
"but there is much more to be done .
the obama administration must thoroughly review how science is used to ensure that our nation's imperiled species have a chance to survive - and thrive . " .
