mark " deep throat " felt dead at 95 .
w. mark felt , sr. , the number 2 man at the fbi during the watergate scandal , died yesterday from alzheimer 's disease at a hospice near his home in santa rosa , california , the washington post reports .
felt was an instrumental player in the stunning downfall of president nixon , but his identity as " deep throat " -reporter bob woodard 's anonymous source for the post 's bombshell series of scoops on the watergate affair in 1972-was unknown until three years ago , when felt 's family unmasked him in the pages of vanity fair .
according to the times , even woodward was shocked at this ; .
he had gaurded the secret so zealously that even his partner carl bernstein did not meet felt until earlier this year .
felt never revealed why he leaked details on the watergate break-in and cover up to woodward , but the times obituary points out that in may 1972 feld had been passed over by nixon as edgar hoover 's successor to run the bureau .
