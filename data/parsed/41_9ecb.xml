the un has disputed claims that hamas militants fired mortars from the gaza school that has suffered the deadliest attack of the war with israel .
three shells hit fakhura , a girls elementary school in the jabalya refugee camp in northern gaza , at about 3pm on tuesday ( 12am yesterday ) , according to un relief and works agency spokesman christopher gunness .
at least 43 people were killed and 55 wounded in the school , where hundreds of palestinians had sought refuge from the fighting , pushing the palestinian death toll above 680 since the conflict began on december 27 .
two people were killed when an artillery shell hit a un school in the southern city of khan younis .
three people also died in an air strike on another un school in gaza city 's shati refugee camp in the centre of the strip .
the carnage appeared to intensify international efforts to arrange a ceasefire - just as deadly strikes on civilians in previous conflicts in lebanon raised pressure on israel to halt hostilities .
israel moved quickly to explain the attack on the jabalya school , saying its forces had been fired on first .
the casualties included hamas militants imad and hassan abu askar , both of whom had fired mortar shells at troops from the school , military officials said .
however , john ging , the top un refugee official in gaza , said un staff and palestinian families in the school compound had been screened for weapons , and he disputed israel 's claim that mortars were fired from inside .
" as far as we are concerned , that is not true , but if israel has evidence of that they need to provide it to an independent inquiry , " mr ging said .
he added : " there 's nowhere safe in gaza .
everyone here is terrorised and traumatised . " .
speaking after an initial investigation last night , mr gunness denied militants were at the school .
" we are 99.9 per cent sure that there were no militants or militant activities in the school and the school compound . " .
mr gunness said earlier that schools were clearly marked with a un flag and that the gps co-ordinates of all un installations in gaza had been given some time ago to the israelis .
he said unrwa wanted an impartial probe of the israeli shelling that could also determine whether militants had used the school for a mortar attack .
mohammad awad , in hospital with shrapnel wounds to the legs and face , said he had come to the school with his family after his house was destroyed in the bombing of a neighbouring home of a hamas leader .
he and other men had been sitting in the schoolyard when shells hit the compound .
" i saw bodies flying and people torn to pieces , " he said .
umm ibrahim said she had lost an eight-year-old daughter and two sons , 11 and 14 .
she had come to the school after a phone warning from the israelis that the family house would be struck because one son was a hamas militant .
" we escaped death in our house , but it pursued us to the school , " she said .
" what can we do ?
where should we go ? " .
although israel said its return fire landed outside the school , witnesses described a series of blasts , which israeli officials said suggested militants had rigged the building with explosives .
" we face a very delicate situation where hamas is using the citizens of gaza as a protective vest , " said military spokesman brigadier general avi benayahu .
the incident renewed questions about israel 's ability to wage a precision war in densely populated gaza even as its forces pushed deeper into the narrow coastal territory .
heavy clashes continued in the north yesterday and airstrikes across the densely populated coastal strip .
an airstrike in the gaza city neighbourhood of zeitun , where much of the heavy fighting has taken place since ground forces invaded on saturday , left one armed militant dead and three wounded , medics said .
clashes were continuing in zeitun , and there were reports of airstrikes on the southern cities of khan younis and rafah .
one rocket made the deepest strike yet into israel - about 32km from tel aviv .
