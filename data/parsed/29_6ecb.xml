locking up the no. 5 seed in the afc playoffs , peyton manning completed 29-of-34 passes for 364 yards and three touchdowns to lead the colts over the jaguars in week 16 .
manning was feeling it tonight .
he completed his first 17 passes , all of them on the money as he methodically took the jags defense apart .
firing beautiful pass after beautiful pass , this was vintage peyton in his best game of the season -- and quite possibly the most accurate performance of his illustrious career .
manning has the indy passing game well-tuned for the playoffs , but he 's likely to close out the season on the bench next week .
if so , his late-season flourish leaves him with 3,907 yards and 26 touchdowns in 15 games. dec. 18 - 11:14 pm et .
