teixeira not headed to boston .
can you believe it ?
i can " t .
yet it " s coming from up top .
red sox owner john henry has said , in so many words , that his team will not sign mark teixeira .
his exact words .
" we met with mr . teixeira and were very much impressed with him .
after hearing about his other offers , however , it seems clear that we are not going to be a factor . " .
you can follow the entire saga on mlb trade rumors .
no one expected this , at least not this soon .
the red sox , the team so many considered the frontrunners for teixeira , will , in the words of the owner himself , not be factors .
it appears , from henry " s words , the price tag is a bit too high .
reports of the red sox offer varied , though wcvb - tv claims it was eight years and $184 million , or a $23 million average annual value .
boston could obviously jump back into the picture , but for now it appears they " ll let the first baseman sign elsewhere .
clearly , i expect a flurry of " now the yankees have to get him " comments .
think about this , though .
there " s at least one offer out there better than eight years and $184 million .
should the yankees go higher than $25 million a season for teixeira ?
