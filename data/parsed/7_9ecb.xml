wladimir klitschko defended his wbo and ibf heavyweight titles in germany today with a lopsided victory over the american hasim rahman , winning by tko in the seventh round .
klitschko dominated the early rounds , repeatedly landing hard jabs that rahman just could n't answer .
in the third round klitschko so thoroughly dominated that i scored it a 10-8 round even though rahman never went down .
klitschko eventually wore rahman down enough to knock him to the canvas in the sixth round -- a round in which rahman did n't land a clean punch at all .
early in the seventh , klitschko staggered rahman , and the ref mercifully stopped it .
klitschko and his brother vitali are generally recognized as the two best heavyweights in the world , and although they 'll never fight each other , i hope they 'll start fighting better opposition than rahman , who is well past his prime and appeared to be out of shape .
mismatches like this one do n't do much to advance heavyweight boxing .
klitschko improved his record to 52-3 and is now on a 10-fight winning streak .
rahman fell to 45-7-2 and is now 10-5-2 with one no contest since knocking out lennox lewis in 2001 .
