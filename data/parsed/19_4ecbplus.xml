a brooklyn woman who claims she had a " bird " s - eye view " of the fatal police shooting of 16 - year - old kimani ( kiki ) gray says the youth did not have a gun in his hand .
tishana king is the only civilian eyewitness to come forward , and her account sharply differs from police commissioner raymond kelly " s assertion that gray had pointed a . 38 - caliber revolver at the cops before they opened fire .
" i " m certain he didn " t have anything in his hands , " king told the daily news .
moments after the saturday shooting , one cop put both hands on his head and said , " ‘ oh , god ! " " king recalled .
" his partner went over to him and put his hand on his shoulder and said , ‘ are you okay , buddy ? " " .
king , 39 , a medical records clerk at kings county hospital , said she gave a tape - recorded interview to detectives several hours after the shooting .
the detectives were aware her 14 - year - old son dialed 911 from their apartment after the gunfire .
but king , in her nearly eight - minute interview with nypd investigators at 3 a . m . on sunday , never said a word about whether gray was carrying a gun .
king emphatically told the news that gray didn " t have a weapon in his hands .
but the newspaper " s review of her nearly eight - minute interview with nypd investigators hours after the shooting shows she never mentioned whether the teen was carrying a gun .
" i couldn " t see what the kids were doing , " she said during the session .
the news reviewed the tape of the q&a conducted in her apartment after the fatal shooting .
detectives and internal affairs bureau investigators never asked directly if king saw gray with a gun , and a police source said nypd policy precludes asking such leading questions .
" they " re just asked to say what happened in as much detail as they can remember , " the source said .
a police spokesman said that when king was asked what she saw by detectives , she told them she couldn't see what the boys were doing "from the angle i was at . " .
but king told the news that , at first , the boys were under her window and that they moved into view when police got out of their car and approached them .
the nypd has not released the names of the sergeant and cop who fired 11 shots .
a police source said the pair initially reported to supervisors that the teen had pulled a gun -- and a loaded weapon was recovered at the scene .
king told the news she was drawn to her third - floor east flatbush window late saturday night by the sound of loud laughing and talking outside on e . 52nd st .
she said she watched as a burgundy - colored sedan pulled up and a man jumped out of the passenger side , followed by the driver .
king initially thought the duo intended to fight with the youths .
when the driver yelled , " don " t move ! " it clicked that they were cops , she said .
" kimani started backing up , " king said .
" the cop took out his gun and started firing at kimani . " .
king said the area was illuminated by a streetlight and gray appeared to be cornered by the cops .
" his ( gray " s ) hands were down , " she said .
" i couldn " t believe he let off ( fired ) his gun .
there was no reason .
no false move . " .
a police source said king never told detectives that gray was backing up with his hands down .
kelly said an " earwitness " heard a cop yell , " what do you have in your hands ? " but a source said the man was too far away to see the confrontation .
the shooting appeared to be within nypd guidelines , he added .
