anger over the death of a brooklyn teenager shot and killed by police fueled a riot on the streets of east flatbush monday -- projectiles were hurled at cops , car windows were smashed and a pharmacy customer had a bottle bashed over his head .
the scenes of violence on blocks near the nypd " s 67th precinct stationhouse followed a protest march that grew out of a candlelight vigil for kimani ( kiki ) gray , 16 , killed by police bullets on saturday .
in the aftermath of the riot , as police were trying to secure the area and assess damage to stores along streets strewn with broken glass , city councilman jumaane williams called for police commissioner raymond kelly and mayor bloomberg to visit the community .
" there " s a lot of anger here , " said williams , whose district includes the riot zone .
" this isn " t just from one particular shooting .
a whole community has not been heard for far too long . " .
kelly visited the precinct stationhouse about 12 : 30 a . m . tuesday -- more than four hours after the chaos began -- but did not speak to reporters .
the vigil for kimani was held at e . 52nd st . and tilden ave . , the location of the shooting , which has caused tensions to simmer in the community , in part because the boy " s family contests police allegations that he was armed with a handgun .
starting at about 8 p . m . , nearly 100 people set off from the vigil site to march the more than 20 blocks to the precinct stationhouse , on snyder ave . near nostrand ave .
but the procession , peaceful at first , turned into a wild confrontation between furious marchers and cops after a faction broke off from the group and began to smash car and store windows with rocks and jump on the tops of vehicles , police sources and witnesses said .
" i was sitting in my living room , " said mary john , 43 , who witnessed destruction near e . 31st st . and church ave .
" people were standing up on vehicles .
i saw them take garbage from the sidewalk and throw it onto the street .
i saw someone take a tv and smash it into my neighbor " s car .
they were throwing rocks at the cars .
" i said , ‘ oh my god !
what " s going on here ? " " she continued .
" they were calling out , ‘ rest in peace , kiki . " .
i was shocked . " .
abdoulaye barry , 24 , who works at african movies , at church ave . and e . 31st st . , described how rioters tried to storm the business .
he said he was outside , saw rioters causing mayhem in the streets , and rushed back to urge his co - workers to lock the store " s gates .
rioters rushed the entrance , fighting with workers as they struggled to lock the roll - down gates , he said .
the workers succeeded -- barely .
but they locked themselves into the store from the inside .
firefighters later had to cut the gates to liberate them .
" it was like the end of the world , " barry told the daily news .
" that " s the first time something like that had happened here . " .
at a rite aid drug store on church ave . near albany ave . , which had about 60 people inside at the time , at least one rioter physically assaulted a customer -- cracking him over the head with a glass bottle .
he was rushed to kings county hospital and listed in stable condition later , a police spokeswoman said .
a manager of the store was also assaulted ; he refused medical attention , the spokeswoman said .
there were unconfirmed reports the store was looted ; the police spokeswoman said only that the cash registers were not robbed .
when cops finally managed to block the mob " s progress , about a block from the 67th precinct stationhouse , rioters began pitching glass bottles at police officers as they moved in on the crowd , a police source said .
one person threw a garbage can at a cop , the source added .
" they " re acting rowdy and calling us racist , " said a police officer at the scene .
as rioters fled into the night and protestors began making their way back toward e . 52nd st . , williams joined the fray and tried to prevent more violence .
" the mayor and the [ police ] commissioner should be down here .
right now ! " .
williams , a critic of nypd policy , said before kelly appeared on the scene .
" there " s a feeling that they don " t really care .
they are leading and policing for one portion of this city .
but they " re not paying attention to the other parts ; they " re not listening to them . " .
public advocate bill de blasio , a democratic candidate for mayor this year , also came to the area monday night .
" i understand if young people are frustrated , but we have to help them understand the way to deal with it should be a peaceful way , " he said .
" they have every right to protest -- that " s the american way . " .
williams said he was not surprised by the riot , only that it hadn " t happened before .
critics of the nypd " s controversial stop - and - frisk policy argued it leads to distrust of the police by the black community because its members are stopped in such high numbers .
" when something happens , we should be able to trust the police and what they say , " williams said .
" police officers shooting black men , black men shooting black men , it " s a problem that needs to be dealt with .
if they want to ignore it , it " s just going to keep happening . " .
following the shooting death of kimani on saturday , police officials said he flashed a gun at a pair of plainclothes cops who approached a stoop where he and others were hanging out .
police said a loaded . 38 - caliber revolver was recovered at the scene -- but family of the slain teen , who was hit multiple times by police bullets , vehemently deny that he was carrying a weapon .
before the riot monday , a police source told the news that investigators believe kimani was a member of the bloods street gang .
the source pointed to two youtube videos , published last year , that featured violence between bloods and crips .
the source said kimani appears in both videos , which the news has refrained from publishing due to graphic content .
in one video , kimani is clad in a red adidas hoodie and goes by the nickname " shapow , " the source said .
he can be seen taunting and hitting a 13 - year - old rival on nostrand ave . near glenwood rd . in flatbush after the adversary flashed gang signs and said he runs with the crips .
kimani also swiped a beaded necklace from the crip and then stomped on it , the video shows , while his friends in the background identified themselves as bloods .
the second video captured an apparent crips retaliation following the smackdown .
a group of self - identified crips stormed a mcdonald " s on utica ave . and ave . h in flatbush after they spotted kimani and other alleged bloods inside , according to the video .
after a minute of heckling and heated exchanges inside the mcdonald " s , the crips retreated outside .
they mocked kimani for refusing to come out into the parking lot .
