wasilla bible church , the home church of alaska gov. sarah palin and her family , received an estimated $ 1 million in damage from a fire that was deliberately set friday night .
no one was injured , but several people , including two children , were inside the church when the blaze started .
palin spokesman bill mcallister said that palin told an assistant pastor she was sorry if the fire was related to the " undeserved negative attention " the church had received since she became the republican vice presidential candidate earlier this year .
" whatever the motives of the arsonist , the governor has faith in the scriptural passage that what was intended for evil will in some way be used for good , " mcallister added .
