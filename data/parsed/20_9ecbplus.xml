sunday , november 27 - 2005 at 16 : 12 .
tremors from an earthquake registering 6 . 1 on the richter scale 60km south west of bandar abbas in iran were felt in dubai today , prompting the evacuation of high - rise buildings on the sheikh zayed road and in the dubai media city .
some eye witnesses reported sensing a definite tremor for one minute , although others told ame info they had not felt anything .
uae authorities are now said to be contacting the us geological survey for details of this seismic activity , which is already listed on the usgs website , www . earthquake . usgs . gov , under the section for recent activity ( see address below ) .
the website reported 65 responses from dubai .
the earth tremor hit a triangular area between ras al khaimah , al ain and dubai .
this follows warnings from local uae academics that earthquake faultlines in iran could have serious implications for building stability in the uae .
seismic risk .
scientists such as dr azm al - homoud from the american university of sharjah have been trying to educate engineers , governments and the construction industry about the risks .
today's incident is bound to prompt a more serious interest in their work .
however , high - rise buildings in the uae all conform to international construction standards and are designed to withstand the sort of minor tremors reported today , although buildings are always thoroughly checked after such events to ensure their integrity .
the dubai authorities are expected to move swiftly to reassure residents that there has been no damage to persons or property .
the emirate is not believed to have had such a tremor in living memory , and clearly some people have been shaken .
such tremors are common in many major cities of the world , but dubai residents have not felt them before and will be looking for answers to the question of likely future seismic activity in the emirate .
but there appears no reason for alarm , as the earthquake was in iran .
