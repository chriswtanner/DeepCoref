united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon today spoke out against israel 's " totally unacceptable " attacks against three clearly-marked united nations schools , where civilians were seeking refuge from the ongoing conflict in gaza , with a senior official calling for an independent inquiry into the incidents which claimed dozens of lives .
more than two dozen schools run by the un relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east ( unrwa ) are serving as temporary shelters to more than 15,000 palestinians whose homes have been destroyed or who are fleeing the violence .
the agency 's education programmes have been suspended since the start of israeli air attacks on gaza , which israel says it launched in response to rocket attacks by hamas militants , on 27 december .
civilians " are seeking sanctuary in unrwa schools because they have no other place to go and are not able to flee the gaza strip , " mr. ban said in a statement .
some 30 people were killed and 55 others injured , five of them critically , when three artillery shells landed at the perimeter of a school , which usually serves as a girls ' preparatory school , in the jabaliya refugee camp , according to john ging , unrwa 's director of operations .
also in jabaliya , a boys ' school was attacked but it was empty , he said .
last night , three palestinians , who had sought refuge in a small co-educational un school in gaza city , died when a missile hit the building 's toilet facilities .
the three men who were killed were " gazans who had fled their home earlier that day , " the unrwa official said , adding that they thought " they would be safe in a un school in gaza city . " .
these attacks reinforce the urgent need for a ceasefire to end the mounting casualties , he said , demanding an independent investigation into these attacks .
" i sincerely hope that for the sake of those that have died , that it would not have been in vain . " .
in a separate incident , seven un staff were injured , three seriously , along with three patients , when a strike on a nearby building caused significant collateral damage to a unrwa health centre .
" the location of all un facilities have been communicated to the israeli authorities and are known to the israeli army , " the secretary-general said .
after earlier strikes , israel 's government had been warned that its operations were endangering un facilities .
" i am deeply dismayed that despite these repeated efforts , today 's tragedies have ensued , " he said .
the israeli attacks against un sites housing civilians seeking refuge are " totally unacceptable and must not be repeated , " mr. ban stressed .
" equally unacceptable are any actions by militants which endanger the palestinian civilian population . " .
these events highlight the dangers posed by continued and stepped up fighting , he said , reiterating his call for an immediate ceasefire .
mr. ban will speak further about the latest developments in gaza and southern israel during a public meeting this evening of the un security council , chaired by french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
the council had met behind closed doors on saturday after israel expanded its week-old air strikes into a ground offensive into gaza , but reached no formal agreement regarding the violence and worsening humanitarian situation .
