maurice cheeks is out as philadelphia 76ers head coach .
general manager ed stefanski announced tony dileo , the team 's assistant general manager and senior vice president , will take over as the head coach for the remainder of the season .
stefanski fired cheeks with the sixers floundering at 9-14 and in the basement of the eastern conference 's atlantic division .
as recently as a season ago , when speaking about cheeks ' new contract extension , stefanski said , " we are excited about the future under this direction . " .
that changed dramatically on saturday .
" i made the decision because i felt we were not progressing the way we wanted to progress , " said stefanski .
" i feel on the floor we were n't executing the philosophy that we want to have as sixers basketball .
i told mo we needed to go in a different direction and make a change .
he was very gracious about it .
he 's a sixer and is rooting for us to turn this around . " .
this past offseason , the sixers bolstered their youthful , athletic roster with frontline cornerstone elton brand , who is leading the team in scoring ( 15.9 ) and rebounding ( 10.0 ) but is significantly short of his career scoring average and has already missed time this season due to injury .
the expectations were high for a team that won 40 games and took detroit to six games in the eastern conference quarterfinal round last season .
cheeks did not meet them .
friday night 's 88-72 loss in cleveland , the team 's eighth in 10 games , was apparently the last straw. cheeks is the fifth nba head coach to be fired this season .
" i believe in this team .
we are better than this , " said stefanski .
" we are going to make it better .
we will find a way to improve on this team. " .
the member of the sixers ' 1982-83 nba championship team started his head coaching career in portland , where he finished with a 162-139 mark and a pair of playoff appearances .
he guided a transition in philadelphia from the allen iverson era and won more games than expected last season behind a rising star , andre iguodala , a young frontcourt led by samuel dalembert and a veteran presence at point guard , andre miller .
miller is averaging 15.5 points per game this season , but iguodala is averaging just 14.9 points per contest , a drop of five points per game from last season .
dalembert is down almost five points per game ( 5.8 ppg ) and just over two rebounds ( 8.0 ) per contest .
dileo is in his 19th season with the sixers basketball operations department .
he spent four seasons as the team 's director of personnel ( 1999-2003 ) before being promoted to senior vp and assistant gm in september 2003 .
