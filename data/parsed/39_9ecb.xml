26-year-old matt smith has been cast as the next incarnation of the doctor .
users on the facebook doctor who forum that i frequent mostly had the same reaction : " who 's matt smith ? " .
the guy is relatively unknown and the skeptics wondered if the right person was chosen .
after all , everyone speculated that paterson joseph , who had appeared on a couple episodes of the show , was going to be the next doctor and here we get some no-name .
