june 25 , 2005 .
a los angeles county sheriff's deputy interviewing a woman and a man outside a hawaiian gardens apartment was fatally shot friday when a gunman burst out of the residence , put a handgun to the officer's face and fired , authorities said .
sheriff's deputies fanned out across hawaiian gardens late friday in search of the gunman , who apparently surprised deputy jerry ortiz , 35 , as he spoke to the woman in the doorway of her apartment .
authorities said ortiz probably died instantly .
"this was an assassination of a deputy , " sheriff lee baca said .
"it was a sudden attack that gave the deputy no chance . " .
deputies identified the suspect as jose luis orozco , 27 , a parolee wanted on suspicion of attempted murder in another case .
"he should be considered armed and very dangerous , " said sheriff's spokesman steve whitmore .
deputies said that orozco is 5 - foot - 8 , 135 pounds , with tattoos of "devil's horns" on his forehead and other tattoos over his upper body .
they said he is a gang member known by the nickname "sepy . " .
ortiz , who had hoped to become a detective soon , had worked for the sheriff's department for 15 years and was known as an extremely hard worker whose job was to penetrate the inner workings of local gangs .
the diamond bar resident was married two weeks ago to his second wife , chela .
he is also survived by two sons , ages 6 and 16 .
last year , ortiz won the department's medal of honor after he fatally shot a carjacker who drew a gun on him and his partner , det . colin orpe .
"he was an outstanding person , who would go out of his way to help people , " said orpe , a longtime friend .
"we're all mourning , " he said , choking back tears .
the shooting occurred about 3 : 10 p . m . in the 12200 block of 223rd street in hawaiian gardens , a working - class city at the northeastern border of long beach that has long been plagued by gang violence .
the town of 14 , 000 has struggled economically in recent years , luring a casino to help balance its shaky finances .
ortiz's body was discovered by residents who heard the gunfire .
they tried to aid the deputy and dialed 911 , authorities said .
ortiz was working without his longtime partner at the time of the attack .
undersheriff larry waldie said ortiz had arrived for work early , as he often did , and was so eager to begin his day that he struck out on his own .
"he didn't want to wait , " waldie said .
asked if ortiz might have lived had his partner been with him , waldie said there was no way to know .
"there might have been two people killed , " he said .
the shooting was followed by confusion as scores of deputies descended on the area with dogs and rifles but little knowledge of what had occurred .
a sheriff's swat team encircled the apartment complex where it was believed that the gunman could be hiding .
patrol deputies detained as many as nine potential witnesses and others in an effort to learn details of the shooting .
nearly all of them were rounded up in a liquor store next to the apartment complex .
television news footage showed the men and women sitting on the curb in handcuffs as deputies interviewed them and swabbed their hands for possible gunshot residue .
