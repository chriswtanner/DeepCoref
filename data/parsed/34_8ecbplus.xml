surgeon general nominee dr . regina benjamin .
i was immediately impressed with dr . regina benjamin's background when president obama nominated her for u . s . surgeon general .
she's led an impressive career , one that includes deciding to practice in a low - income community in the gulf coast of alabama .
the bayou la batre rural health clinic has been a staple for residents since 1987 and often doesn't charge patients who can't afford to pay .
the clinic also focuses heavily on preventative illness since this hits close to home for dr . benjamin .
she lost her father to diabetics and high - blood pressure , her mother to lung cancer and her brother from a hiv - related illness .
personally and professionally , dr . benjamin has longed fought for the well - being of others .
after researching her background , i had a gut feeling she was a member of delta sigma theta sorority , inc . , a non - profit community service based organization .
and it was confirmed several days later when the sorority's national president announced dr . benjamin became a member while completing her undergraduate degree at xavier university in new orleans , la .
while i wasn't the only one impressed with dr . benjamin's background , there were also some who questioned her ability to perform the duties of surgeon general .
an article with the subtitle : "do you have to be thin to be fit for the role of nation's top doc ? " , was published shortly after dr . benjamin's nomination .
dr . arthur caplan penned the article and defended dr . benjamin due to her tireless effort of serving those less fortunate .
i applaud him for taking a stand on dr . benjamin's behalf .
i don't condone a unhealthy lifestyle , but i'm sure dr . benjamin is probably like many of us .
with hectic work schedules and families , it can be difficult to find time to lead a healthy lifestyle .
i struggle with juggling my to - do - list daily and sometimes exercise and healthy eating doesn't make the cut .
it's no secret that women are confronted with these issues more than men .
i'm calling on women to speak up for dr . benjamin .
you don't have to agree with the policies of president obama or even with the nomination of dr . benjamin , but we can't continue to allow society to dictate our outer appearance .
women , start making your moves today !
