pierre thomas placed on injured reserve .
jan 5 , 2011 -- 4 : 35 pm .
pierre thomas , the saints' leading rusher in 2009 , was put on injured reserve , the team announced wednesday .
thomas has an ankle injury , and he is the second running back in two days to be placed on ir as new orleans prepares for its wild - card round playoff game at seattle .
the saints placed rookie chris ivory on injured reserve tuesday - - another huge blow , because he was the club's leading rusher this season .
that leaves reggie bush , julius jones and the newly - signed joique bell , who was added off the eagles' practice squad when thomas was placed on ir , to carry the load in the saints' backfield .
the saints do not generally run the ball much anyway - - new orleans finished 30th in the nfl in rushing attempts this season , with 380 .
they do , however , use their running backs frequently out of the backfield in the short passing game , and thomas' absence will hurt there .
ivory , who had made strides with ball security , showed off his power this season , running through arm tackles and over lighter linebackers en route to 716 yards rushing .
thomas was hurt in the saints' game vs . atlanta game in september and missed 10 games , including last sunday's loss to the tampa bay buccaneers .
he had just 269 yards rushing .
new orleans has never used reggie bush as a feature - type back , but as more of a third - down , all - purpose running back .
it is likely he will get 10 to 12 carries on saturday .
the saints are not likely to expose him to more than that , not with the depth being in such critical shape .
there was good news for new orleans : wide receiver marques colston was a full participant in practice on wednesday .
he did not play last sunday after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery last tuesday .
safety malcolm jenkins ( knee ) , tight end jimmy graham ( ankle ) , defensive tackle anthony hargrove ( knee ) and linebacker danny clark ( hamstring ) did not participate in team drills wednesday .
it is not certain what their status is for saturday .
tight end jeremy shockey ( groin ) and tight end david thomas ( knee ) were limited in wednesday's practice , which is encouraging because of graham's ankle injury .
