australian actor hugh jackman was named on friday as host of february 's oscars in a departure from the tradition of picking u.s. comedians on hollywood 's most prestigious night .
the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences , which hands out the world 's top film honors , said jackman , 40 , star of the romantic epic " australia , " will host the televised ceremony for the first time .
the actor , who also starred in the three " x-men " movies and is an award-winning musical theater performer , has hosted broadway 's tony awards three times and last month was named 2008 's " sexiest man alive " by people magazine .
" hugh jackman is a consummate entertainer and an internationally renowned movie star , " said laurence mark and bill condon , the new producers of the televised show .
" he also has style , elegance and a sense of occasion .
hugh is the ideal choice to host a celebration of the year 's movies -- and to have fun doing it , " the pair said in a statement .
oscar nominations for the best movies and performances of 2008 will be announced in january .
the awards will be handed out on february 22 by the academy at the kodak theater in hollywood and will be televised in the united states by the abc network .
jackman 's choice heralds a new direction for the 81st oscar ceremony after recent years of falling tv ratings .
typically , the program has been hosted by u.s. comedians , and in recent years , show organizers have experimented with a variety of hosting styles ranging from political satirist jon stewart , to edgy chris rock and popular ellen degeneres .
mark and condon have axed the famous opening monologue for the february 2009 show , hoping for more spontaneity overall .
they said there may be a stronger element of music and dancing than previously .
" we want it to be more of a party and a celebration and a departure from the late-night talk-show format , " mark told reuters .
mark and condon have a background in musicals and worked together on the 2006 film hit " dreamgirls " .
jackman , who can sing and dance , was " genuinely thrilled " at the offer , mark said , but " he wanted to make sure the format would mesh with his skills . " .
the february 2008 three-hour plus broadcast , hosted for the second time by stewart , hit a low 32 million u.s. viewers and entered the record books as the least-watched oscars ever .
still , even an audience of that size makes the telecast annually one of the most-watched u.s. tv shows .
the broadcast also is televised live in more than 200 countries worldwide .
mark said he and condon planned to get the telecast under three hours , yet still keep the live presentations of awards and acceptance speeches .
