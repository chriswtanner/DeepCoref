mumbai , nov 11 - .
indian navy patrolling the gulf of aden yesterday thwarted a multi - boat attack by sea brigands on merchant vessels , apprehending 26 somali pirates and confiscating arms and ammunition , in the fifth successful anti - piracy operation since september .
at about 9 : 25 thursday morning , navy personnel aboard warship ins sukanya spotted a group of five suspicious boats speedily approaching the merchant vessels of her group .
"the warship immediately altered ( its direction ) towards the suspicious vessels and challenged them .
on seeing the resolve evident in the warship's action and probably mindful of the reputation for resolute action that the indian navy justly enjoys in such deployments , the pirate skiffs reversed course and tried to flee the area , " captain manohar nambiar , chief public relations officer , defence , said .
while two of them managed to escape , ins sukanya successfully intercepted the remaining three boats and , in a well - practiced and professionally executed boarding - and - search action , nabbed 26 somali pirates with six ak 47 rifles , 12 magazines and about 300 rounds of ammunition .
this is the fifth successful anti - piracy operation conducted by ins sukanya in the course of her ongoing patrol mission in the gulf of aden that commenced in september , the navy said .
warship sukanya , currently deployed on anti - piracy patrols in the gulf of aden under the operational control of the western naval command , was escorting a group of five merchant vessels through the internationally recognised transit corridor when the incident happened .
the timely operation by ins sukanya resulted , once again , in foiling the pirates' attempt to attack merchant vessels transiting the busy sea lane through which over nearly 100 billion usd worth india's external trade passes each year , nambiar said .
in their five operations so far , the personnel on board the warship have confiscated 14 ak - 47 rifles , 31 magazines and 923 rounds of ammunition , he said .
indian navy is part of the international effort to ensure the safety and freedom of seaborne trade in this high - risk stronghold of modern - day piracy .
