the academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced friday that hugh jackman will be the host of the 81st annual oscars on feb. 22 at the kodak theatre .
the lanky australian , who was recently named people magazine 's sexiest man alive , is best known for playing wolverine in the " x-men " franchise , including the upcoming " x-men origins : wolverine , " and for his romantic adventure roles in the current period drama " australia " and as a vampire hunter in " van helsing . " .
not exactly the wild and crazy comedy type that has been hosting the oscars for the last 20 years , a list that includes names such as billy crystal , david letterman , steve martin , whoopi goldberg , jon stewart and ellen degeneres .
in addition to looking great in a tux , the 40-year-old jackman has tv hosting experience .
he emceed both the 2004 and 2005 tony awards , and won an emmy award for his first go at hosting that award show .
" he is so sparkling and personable , and he delivers , " said academy president sid ganis .
" i saw him recently at a motion picture home event on the sony lot .
he is charming and pleasant .
the other thing is .
he loves [ being the host ] .
he loves the patter .
he likes to wink his eye at an audience and have fun . " .
while it 's been more than two decades since a non-comedian was one of the academy award hosts , the jackman announcement is hardly unprecedented .
numerous actors , directors and even producers have served as master of ceremonies .
douglas fairbanks , laurence olivier , james stewart , ingrid bergman , jane fonda , alan alda , claudette colbert , fredric march , agnes moorhead , thelma ritter , fred astaire and charlton heston have all played host on oscar night .
" we 're sort of going back to the pre-bob hope days a little bit , " said oscar producer laurence mark , explaining that the decision to return to an actor as host was influenced by a desire to change what he called the " late-night talk-show " feel of past programs .
" we wanted to take the show to another form , " mark said .
" hugh seemed to be the perfect person .
the lovely thing about the show is it is a tv show set in a theater about the movies , so the fact that he is a movie star ... he 's also an extraordinary stage presence and he does actually have an emmy award for hosting the tonys .
he fits all three bills . " .
" thirty years ago when i was in sydney watching johnny carson host the oscars with my family , i never imagined that i 'd one day have the chance to be up on that stage myself , " jackman said in a statement .
the academy is hoping that jackman 's international appeal will help bring more viewers to the annual event that is telecast on abc .
ratings for the oscar telecast have declined sharply in recent years , especially among young-adult audiences .
the 2008 telecast delivered 32 million total viewers , a 24 % drop compared with the previous year 's ceremony , according to figures from nielsen media research .
the most-watched academy awards in recent years was in 1998 , when " titanic " won best picture .
a total of 55.3 million people tuned in to watch who took home the golden statuettes .
" we hope [ jackman 's ] appeal is going to broaden us out , " ganis said .
" we all know the ratings are down , but we are going to have something pretty special . " .
