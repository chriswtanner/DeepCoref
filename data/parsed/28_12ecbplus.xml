his body was discovered yesterday by a maid who entered his hotel room in biloxi .

he served four months in federal prison for conspiracy to obstruct justice .
mr . larue served as special assistant to mitchell , who later headed president nixon's reelection committee .
mr . larue was present at a 1972 meeting with mitchell and nixon aide jeb stuart magruder at nixon's vacation home in key biscayne , fla . , where the plan to break into the watergate complex in washington was allegedly hatched .
mr . larue said he advised against the burglarization of the building , which housed democratic party headquarters .
after his political career ended in scandal , mr . larue returned to his home state of mississippi to work in his family's oil company and with its real estate holdings .
he also spent much time catching shrimp in the gulf of mexico .
a few researchers of the scandal have suggested that mr . larue could have been deep throat .
he discounted those rumors , saying the mysterious source for washington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein on the watergate story was not one person , but probably a combination of several people .
