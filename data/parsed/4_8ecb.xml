bettie page , one of entertainment 's original sex kittens , the 1950s pin-up queen who many credit with having paved the way for the sexual revolution of the following decade , passed away thursday , december 11 , at age 85 .
bettie page died thursday of pneumonia at a los angeles area hospital , longtime agent mark roesler said .
she had suffered a heart attack earlier in december and never regained consciousness .
he said he and page 's family agreed to take her off life support .
roesler described her as " the embodiment of beauty , " and enthused that she " captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality . " .
bettie page 's signature raven-black long hair , her bangs , the red lipstick , her full , seductively rounded body and her provocative poses made her into a bona fide pin-up queen in the nineteen fifties .
her fame endured throughout the decades , even after she retreated from the spotlight and struggled with mental illness , moved around the country and became a born-again christian .
she was born betty mae page on april 22 , 1923 in nashville , tennessee , in an impoverished family with six children .
despite being confronted with an abusive father who eventually went to prison and having to live in orphanages at times , page grew up a great fan of hollywood movies and was successful in school , as salutatorian of her high school graduating class .
her classmates voted her " most likely to succeed . " .
she received an arts degree with peabody college in nashville and started modeling in the 1940s after moving to san francisco with her first husband .
they divorced in 1947 and page continued her modeling work in new york .
as chance would have it , photos from a shoot with miami photographer bunny yeager ended up in the pages of playboy .
this would forever change page 's life , as she became on of the two-year-old magazine 's first centerfolds in the january 1955 issue .
kneeling before a christmas tree , wearing a santa hat and a playful wink ( and that 's all ) and holding a christmas tree ornament , playboy founder hugh hefner described the layout as " a milestone in the history of the magazine . " .
a few years later , page modeled in bondage and sadomasochistic poses .
this caused great controversy , as the photographs were criticized by some as perversion and a congressional investigation was launched into pornography .
by the late 1950s , bettie page had virtually disappeared from the public eye , having retreated to focus on her own personal life .
she became a born-again christian and worked for billy graham 's ministry , among others .
she married two more times yet both unions failed .
beginning with the 1970s , she battled mental illness and was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic .
during her retreat from the spotlight , page was completely oblivious of the fascination she had ignited in the public .
she made a comeback almost two decades later , signing memorabilia at conventions and occasionally granted interviews .
she refused to have her photograph taken .
page had no children .
a private funeral service will be held tuesday , dec. 16 , at westwood memorial cemetery .
