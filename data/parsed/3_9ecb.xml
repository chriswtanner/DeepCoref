a judge on saturday sentenced the man who killed four people in a brazen courthouse escape to multiple life sentences with no chance of parole after a deadlocked jury failed to return a death sentence .
brian nichols , 37 , was found guilty last month of murder and dozens of other counts for the march 2005 rampage that started in a downtown courthouse , led to an atlanta neighborhood and ended with his capture the next day in a suburban county .
he will likely die in prison after superior court judge james bodiford handed down the maximum sentence on each charge .
" if there was any more i could give you , i would , " the judge said .
nichols was spared capital punishment when the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision to condemn him to death row for the murders of a judge , a court reporter , a deputy and a federal agent .
after four days and more than 30 hours of deliberations , the jury was deadlocked at 9-3 , with nine in favor of the death penalty and three voting for life without parole .
nichols , who argued he was mentally insane when he carried out the killings , spoke for the first time in court on saturday .
" i just wanted to say that i know that the things i 've done caused a lot of pain and i 'm sorry , " he said .
" and i just wanted to say that i will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life .
that 's it . " .
the sentence caps more than three years of efforts to bring nichols to justice since his arrest that were repeatedly bogged down by legal complications , frustrating victims ' relatives and angering state legislators over the costs .
the rampage prompted attorneys and judges to question their safety and law enforcement around the state to re-examine courthouse security measures .
the deadlocked jury was a setback for prosecutors , who turned down an offer from nichols ' attorneys to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence .
but district attorney paul howard said he has spoken with u.s. attorneys about a possible death penalty trial against nichols in federal court for the killing of the off-duty federal agent .
howard also said georgia prosecutors need more leeway to strike jurors who are reluctant to vote for the death penalty .
he said jurors have told him that the three holdouts refused to deliberate and one even wore headphones during the closed-door discussions this week .
" the community has spoken , " he said .
" even though we are puzzled and terribly disappointed by the decision , we must accept the conclusion provided by our community . " .
in a tearful post-trial press conference , the families of the victims thanked the prosecutors for going through with the trial , as painful as it was .
" i believe brian nichols did not win .
in his own words , he said it 's not his dna to stay in jail , " said christina greenway , daughter of slain court reporter julie ann brandau .
" which is what he has to look forward to the rest of his life. i 'm not disappointed and i have no regrets . " .
nichols was being escorted to his trial for rape when he beat a deputy guarding him and stole her gun .
he burst into the courtroom and shot and killed superior court judge rowland barnes , brandau and deputy hoyt teasley .
he fled downtown atlanta and managed to evade hundreds of police officers searching for him overnight .
in atlanta 's posh buckhead neighborhood , he shot and killed federal agent david wilhelm at a house the agent was renovating .
the judge , after sentencing nichols to the slew of charges , urged the victims ' of nichols ' crimes to try their best to regroup .
" we 've learned a lot from this horrible tragedy , and as horrible as it was , we need to learn from this and make sure it never happens again , " said bodiford .
the judge offered advice for the prison guards who will handle nichols .
" do not trust mr. nichols ever again .
ever again .
because he can not be trusted . " .
