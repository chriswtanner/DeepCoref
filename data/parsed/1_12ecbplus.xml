" the " mean girls " star fooled an l . a superior court judge , a santa monica prosecutor and apparently her own lawyer , by pretending to check into a rehabilitation facility , but chickening out when she got there .
prosecutor terry white told the post a couple hours after a court hearing -- where lohan " s lawyer mark heller said she was " ensconced in the bosom " of morningside recovery in newport beach -- " i hear she " s on her way to lax and getting on a flight back to new york . " .
unfortunately , morningside is unlicensed and photogs snapped her shopping for gadgets at the very moment of her alleged check in .
lohan reportedly pulled up to morningside in an suv but the vehicle left without the actress ever getting out .
" the facility that lindsay is now in , that " s not a licensed residential drug treatment center , " california department of alcohol and drug program deputy director millicent tidwell told the post .
