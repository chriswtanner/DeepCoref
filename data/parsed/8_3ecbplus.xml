riots over harsh new austerity measures left three bank workers dead and engulfed the streets of athens on wednesday , as angry protesters tried to storm parliament , hurled molotov cocktails at police and torched buildings .
police responded with barrages of tear gas .
tens of thousands of people took to the streets in a nationwide strike to protest new taxes and government spending cuts demanded by the international monetary fund and other european nations before heavily indebted greece gets a euro110 billion ( $141 billion ) loan package to keep it from defaulting .
the three bank workers a man and two women died after demonstrators set their bank on fire along the main demonstration route in central athens .
as their colleagues sobbed in the street , five other bank workers were rescued from the balcony of the burning building .
"a demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another ! " prime minister george papandreou thundered in parliament during a session to discuss the spending cuts he announced sunday measures even the imf has called draconian .
lawmakers held a minute of silence for the dead the first deaths during a protest in greece since 1991 .
"we are all concerned by greece's economic and budgetary situation but at this time our thoughts are with the human victims in athens , " european union president herman van rompuy said in brussels .
a senior fire department official said demonstrators prevented firefighters from reaching the burning building , costing them vital time .
"several crucial minutes were lost , " the official said , visibly upset .
"if we had intervened earlier , the loss of life could have been prevented . " .
he asked not to be identified pending an official announcement .
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel called the greek bailout critical for all of europe .
"nothing less than the future of europe , and with that the future of germany in europe , is at stake , " merkel told lawmakers in berlin , urging them to quickly pass the country's share of the bailout euro22 billion ( $28 billion ) over three years by friday .
"we are at a fork in the road . " .
greece faces a may 19 due date on debt it says it can't repay without the help .
in brussels , european union officials desperately tried to calm market fears that greece's debt crisis was spreading to the rest of europe , insisting it was a "unique case" combining profligacy and tampered accounts .
van rompuy insisted the growing debt problems in spain and portugal had "absolutely nothing to do with the situation in greece . " .
"greece is a unique and particular case in the eu" because of its "precarious debt dynamics" and because it "has cheated with its statistics for years and years , " eu commissioner olli rehn said .
but moody's investor services , a major ratings agency , put portugal's bond rating on review for possible downgrade wednesday .
spanish and portuguese bonds and stocks slumped further on the news , reflecting fears that they may also have trouble repaying their debt and that the eurozone would have to extend even larger bailouts to them .
on the streets of athens , demonstrators chanted "thieves , thieves ! " as they attempted to break through a riot police cordon guarding parliament and chased ceremonial guards away from the tomb of the unknown soldier in front of the building .
tear gas drifted across the city center as rioters hurled paving stones and fire bombs at police .
firefighters extinguished blazes at least two buildings the bank and a branch of the finance ministry while protesters set up burning barricades and torched cars and a fire truck .
police said 12 people were injured in the riots .
the marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from greece , shut down ports , schools and government services , and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff .
the acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed and journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .
but media later broke the strike to report on the deaths and the protests .
violence also broke out in the northern city of thessaloniki , where another 20 , 000 people marched through the city center and some youths smashed store windows .
union reaction over austerity measures until now had been relatively muted by greece's volatile standards , despite several previous strikes .
but anger mounted after papandreou announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants and another round of consumer tax increases .
papandreou said he has no choice but to implement the measures if greece was to avoid bankruptcy .
"there was only one other solution for the country to default , taking the citizenry with it .
and that would not have affected the rich , it would have affected workers and pensioners , " he told parliament on wednesday .
"that was a real possibility , however nightmarish . " .
under the bailout package , greece will receive loans over three years from the imf and the other 15 countries who share the euro currency .
the rescue aims to prevent athens' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the euro .
but the rioting underlined skepticism that the greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the euro below $1 . 29 for the first time in over a year .
even with the bailout , many economists think greece will eventually default on or restructure its debts because its prospects for economic growth are so poor over the next several years , hurting government revenue .
some fear the austerity measures insisted upon by the eu and imf could make prospects for growth even worse .
unions say low - income greeks will suffer disproportionately from the latest austerity measures , which aim to save euro30 billion ( $40 billion ) the country's current budget deficit through 2012 .
"these people are losing their rights , they are losing their future , " said yiannis panagopoulos , head of gsee , one of the two largest unions .
"the country cannot surrender without a fight . " .
imf chief dominique strauss - kahn warned that the crisis could spread to other countries despite the rescue package's efforts to contain it .
"everyone must remain extremely vigilant" to this risk , strauss - kahn said in an interview in french newspaper le parisien wednesday .
"i completely understand the greek population's anger , its incomprehension at the size of the economic catastrophe , " strauss - kahn said .
but , he said , greeks must also understand that without these measures "the situation would be infinitely more serious . " .
the draft bill of the new austerity measures is to be voted on thursday .
papandreou's socialists hold a comfortable majority of 160 in the 300 - seat parliament and the bill is expected to pass easily .
