angels general manager tony reagins confirmed to the los angeles times that he has made an eight-year offer to free agent first baseman mark teixeira .
regains did n't reveal the dollar amounts , but the newspaper speculates the deal is worth at least $ 160 million .
teixeira is considered the top offensive player available on the free agent market , and the orioles ( seven years , $ 140- $ 150 million ) and nationals ( eight years , $ 160 million ) reportedly have made sizeable offers as well .
the red sox , considered to be the front-runner for teixeira , also have put in a bid , though monetary details have been kept quiet .
there has been talk of the yankees being in the teixeira sweepstakes as well .
teixeira , 28 , has hit at least 30 homers and driven in at least 105 runs in each of the past five seasons .
after being acquired from the braves before the trading deadline this past season , teixeira hit .358 with 13 homers and 43 rbis in 54 games with the angels .
