tennant has now been voted one of the most popular doctors of all time and is handing his sonic screwdriver over to actor matt smith .
of course , there has been a media frenzy , with practically every national tabloid screaming " who ? ? " .
but the casting of smith is a stroke of genius : he will not bring any " star personality " with him that perhaps a " name " would have , but he seems utterly committed , and i have to say he does have an other-worldly look to him .
