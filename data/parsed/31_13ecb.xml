the historical record will show that with 7:42 remaining in the first half against evansville 's purple aces , tyler hansbrough became unc 's all-time leading scorer , slipping a screen , fighting through a double-team , and banking in a two-pointer for his tenth point of the game and the 2,292nd point of his career .
the record will show this in no small part because at least 20 sportswriters were diligently typing behind the home basket , writing versions of the same words at the very same moment .
if there was going to be any mistake , it was quickly corrected by carolina 's sports information army , abuzz all evening to ensure the moment was preserved perfectly .
then there were the photographers , on hand to document each move , each point , each congratulatory handshake .
beyond them , more than 20,000 witnesses ran their own internal documentary systems , surely thinking about how they 'll tell future generations of tar heel fans that they were present .
some might remember the moment coming at 7:41 , a tick of a second later than the actual basket , when the game clock was stopped for a tastefully brief ceremony and the obligatory photo op .
let the record show their memories were wrong , but it wo n't diminish the telling and retelling until history becomes legend , as it usually does .
often history happens in quieter places , witnessed by fewer people , not fully appreciated or understood until much later .
but this episode was not left for chance .
it had been anticipated for months , ever since carolina 's lunch-bucket all-american decided to return for his senior season -- not because he cared a lick about breaking phil ford 's almost 30-year-old record , but because he loves student life on campus , loves basketball , and wanted to keep doing both at the same time as long as possible .
the only hitch in the script was a sore shin and a twisted ankle that deferred the night for a few weeks , into late december , an early christmas gift to the faithful who filled ( well , almost filled ) the smith center on a misty night .
everything else followed the script nicely .
espn dutifully ensured a national audience would share the moment on television .
then hansbrough 's father , gene , made his surprise arrival at a game he was n't expected to attend .
but how could he miss it , really ?
having nurtured his son 's talent and his competitive drive and his character and everything else along the way , history demanded he be in his seat , ready to stand and salute his son as he swallowed down the lump in his throat and expressed his love and thanks .
evansville proved the story 's perfect villain , keeping it close through the early stages , and giving an already charged-up crowd opportunity to boo lustily as the purple aces ' physical big men knocked hansbrough to the ground on several occasions .
did n't they know that 's how hansbrough would have wanted it -- physically challenged , and therefore determined to crush them into submission ?
ford , meanwhile , made a gentlemanly entrance , gracefully shook hands with fans of all ages , posed for pictures , and waited in the wings for history to arrive .
after it did , he was pure class , thanking roy williams , hansbrough , and the university for asking him to be a part of the night .
" it 's a dream come true for me , " he said , sounding genuinely honored to be passing the torch to a player who , like him , gave his best for the program and properly understands that team success , not individual records , are the real measure of success .
even with the game underway and subject to unpredictable bounces , an official 's phantom call , or some other twist of fate , the script held .
the first points came from the foul line , swishing through the basket without a doubt , as they have more often than for any other carolina player before him .
one reminder of greatness in the books .
the next points rapidly followed on a series of jumpers , well beyond the range of anything doubters expected the brawling forward to hit on a regular basis when he was a freshman .
" i 'll prove you wrong , " you could almost hear him thinking as he hit each one , showcasing the senior 's evolution into a complete player .
another reminder : players like this come along only once in a generation .
then there was the struggle , as teammates worked to get him the ball in scoring position .
having told everyone he wanted to break the record on a three , he camped out on the wing for one possession but failed to get a touch .
on another , he posted hard inside as danny green took and missed an open three ; .
as the heels ran to the other end , williams appeared to holler at green for failing to look inside first .
on this night , with history looming , even good quality shots needed to wait for the moment .
but the struggle was needed , too .
has n't that been the essence of carolina 's working-class hero : the battler , scrapping for everything , finding success as much through passion as through athletic ability or skill ?
it took will -- and a brief stint on the bench -- before the moment came .
then , sure as sure , it did .
because it did , a number of things will be quickly forgotten .
though tywon lawson had another dominant performance and danny green ( who broke a milestone of his own with his 1,000th career point ) showcased the increasingly confident game that makes his summer draft experiment seem less surprising , the tar heels grinded their way through a game with 16 turnovers -- two more than evansville -- and only 17 assists .
deon thompson never established a rhythm , taken out of his finesse game by the purple aces ' physical style .
early in the second half , williams yanked out all five starters and replaced them with a blue team , unhappy with the focus and effort .
and wayne ellington 's shooting slump continued , his normally perfect stroke disconcertingly slow to return from the finals break .
it was another double-digit win , and against a quality mid-major opponent , but a work of art it was n't .
hansbrough , who looked as though he was pressing all night despite finishing with another 20-point , 9-rebound performance , admitted to the nerves .
they were particularly evident on his next touch after the record-breaking points , when hansbrough stole an inbounds pass , only to brick a dunk attempt off the back of the rim -- another moment that will probably be erased as history gives way to legend .
" i felt like there was a lot of pressure , " he said .
" i did n't want to strictly focus on the scoring record .
we had a game and i was trying to do whatever i could to help the team .
now i 'm glad it 's over , and i 'm ready to move on . " .
williams agreed .
" i said , " i 'm glad we got that behind us , now let 's focus on playing better , and let 's focus on guarding somebody . " .
i do n't look up at the scoreboard , but it was the first time that i can ever remember counting points in my head .
so when [ the shot ] goes in , it was immediately a feeling of elation , and [ then ] a feeling of relief that we got that out of the way . " .
danny green acknowledged the team was ready to move on as well .
" yeah , definitely , " he said .
" the one record we want to break is the winning record , going undefeated for an entire season and hopefully getting a national championship .
that 's the record i want to achieve . " .
history will remember this night , the emotions of the tribute video that followed the game , and the warmth of the celebratory laughter in the media room .
but in the locker room , business remained .
and in a brief quote that will probably be lost to memory , phil ford told the real story of the night in words that will echo until winter turns to spring .
" when i was coach here , if we did n't make the final four , it was a bad season , " he said .
" and now , this guy , " he continued , looking to hansbrough , " if he does n't win a national title , he has a bad season . " .
hansbrough did n't flinch , but the eyes flashed with recognition .
the record is set , but history is still waiting .
