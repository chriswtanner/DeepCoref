microsoft issues emergency ie patch as attacks escalate .
microsoft has issued a rare emergency update for its internet explorer browser as miscreants stepped up attacks targeting a vulnerability on hundreds of thousands of webpages .
in many cases , the websites distributing the toxic payload are legitimate destinations that have been commandeered , allowing an attacker to snare victims as they surf to online banks , forums , and other trusted sites .
there are at least six distinct versions of attack code circulating in the wild , according to researchers at idefense , a security lab owned by verisign .
a web search showed 233,000 pages containing the string ardoshanghai.com/s.js , just one of many web addresses exploiting a weakness in the way ie 's data-binding function works .
most of the attacks silently install keylogging software as soon as a victim surfs to a site carrying the exploit .
once installed , the software steals login credentials for online games .
attack strings in separate sql injections include 17gamo.com/1.js .
researchers say the number of attack sites is too high to keep exhaustive lists , but shadowserver is doing an admirable job here .
" the vulnerability is so juicy that we expect it to show up in tool kits fairly shortly , " said rick howard , intelligence director of idefense .
the patch was released eight days after reports began circulating that websites were targeting a vulnerability in fully patched versions of ie .
this is only the second time in 18 months that microsoft has issued an unscheduled update .
typically , patches are available on the second tuesday of each month to allow system administrators time for planning .
given the prevalence of attacks , there 's no good reason why anyone running a windows machine should n't stop what they 're doing and install the patch immediately ( those with administrative rights , anyway ) - doing so is as easy as opening ie and selecting windows update from the tools menu .
the patch can also be downloaded directly here .
howard mentioned the site of " a major financial institution " that he found hosting the exploit , so do n't think you 're immune just because you steer clear of porn and warez .
