november 14 , 2011|12 : 35 pm .
the government of sudan bombed the samaritan's purse refugee camp in yida , south sudan , on thursday , nov . 10 , alleges the nondenominational evangelical christian organization .
the camp , located in the oil - rich northern region of yida , consists of over 24 , 000 refugees who have fled the heavy fighting of sudan's south kordofan region .
the camp at yida is an area of thick bush just about ten miles south of the generally recognized border between south sudan and sudan .
the bombing was a result of the heightening tensions between sudan and south sudan .
south sudan gained its independence from sudan 6 months ago , ending one of africa's longest civil wars .
sudan accuses south sudan of arming sudanese rebels in the border states of southern kordofan and the blue nile , according to the new york times .
samaritan's purse provides aid , both spiritually and physically , to those in need .
the organization uses dc - 3 planes to deliver food to the refugees of yida .
the planes deliver six to seven loads a day , three days a week .
the organization has dropped 420 tons of food staples to the refugees , and is in connection with the u . n . 's world food program .
according to a samaritan's purse press release , sudan armed forces planes dropped four bombs at 3 : 20 p . m . in the region thursday .
ken isaacs , vice president of programs and government relations at samaritan's purse , told the christian post that the bombing as a "terrifying event for all of the staff and the people in our community . " .
one bomb hit a 200 - student schoolhouse but did not explode , another bomb hit the community marketplace and two others hit the outskirts of the camp .
the bombs did not do any damage and , according to isaacs , one bomb landed just 5 feet away from a boy , but did not explode .
" [ the ] minetech international ( mti ) explosive ordinance disposal ( eod ) team removed the bomb from the yida village school and moved it to an isolated location for disposal at a later date , " according to the united nations mine action coordination center of south sudan .
"i urge the united states and the international community to enforce a no - fly zone in the area to protect not only the innocent civilians there but also those who are trying to help them , " samaritan's purse president franklin graham said in a press release .
"my prayer is that the world will not just sit by and watch and hope for the best like they did during rwanda , where close to a million people were massacred .
we need to make it clear to the government of sudan that attacks on innocent people will not be tolerated , " the evangelist said .
the white house has also condemned the bombing .
in a press statement released nov . 10 , the white house urged the government to stop the bombings immediately .
"we urge the government of south sudan to exercise restraint in responding to this provocation to prevent further escalation of hostilities , " read the press release .
the refugee camp had just received food rations when the bombing took place .
graham said these bombings are a tactic reminiscent of sudan's civil war , used to injure and kill as many as possible .
the food is delivered , the attackers wait for people to gather to collect the food , and then they bomb the masses .
according to the new york times , a satellite - imaging program reveals a build - up of sudanese troops near the south sudan border in the blue nile region .
images also reportedly reveal upgraded air bases recently captured by government forces .
sudan's government denies a connection to the bombing .
sudanese government spokesperson rabie a . atti defended the government sunday , saying , "we are only securing our border . " .
susan rice , u . s . ambassador for the united nations , said the sudan government "blatantly lied" about the bombing , adding that such a lie proves very disturbing to the united states and many members of the u . n . security council .
as isaacs of samaritan's purse contends , sudan's government denied any bombing in "south sudan . " .
"what do they consider to be south sudan ? " isaacs questioned , noting that there are elements of a border dispute , with yida being only 10 miles from the border .
describing yida as a "very insecure" area , isaacs expressed worry for the future of yida's refugees .
"the conflict and the insecurity are going to grow .
it is going to get worse before it gets better , " he said .
"there is a need to relocate the people .
the areas that have been offered for relocation are not agreeable , " he added .
according to isaacs , food supplies are rapidly dwindling .
the refugees received a three - day ration on oct . 29 , a one - day ration on nov . 7th and a one - day ration on nov . 11 .
"we are looking to world food programme and the unhcr to fully respond to the needs [ of the people ] .
we appreciate what they're doing but we remain deeply concerned for the people , " isaacs said .
