athens vigil ends in violence .
violence reignited in athens following vigils for the teenager killed by police a week ago .
greek rioters have attacked an environment ministry building , shops and banks in athens on the eighth day of protests following the killing of a teenager by police .
the clashes late on saturday came after an evening candle-lit vigil to mark the shooting of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos .
youths attacked a police station with petrol bombs in central athens as well as at least three banks , several stores and a government building , police said .
several hundred protesters set up burning barricades and attacked police with rocks and flares .
the killing of grigoropoulos has sparked the worst rioting greece has seen in decades , with at least 70 people injured in cities across the country .
hundreds of stores have been smashed and looted , and more than 200 people have been arrested .
earlier , hundreds of schoolchildren holding candles gathered peacefully outside the parliament building in athens and at the site where grigoropoulos was shot .
they left candles spelling out the name " alex " in front of a line of riot policemen .
banners in the main square outside parliament read : " the state kills " and " down with the government of murderers " .
" the murder of alexis was the last straw .
being a young man in greece today is a crime ... .
they are stealing our dreams , " said one leaflet distributed in the square .
the young protesters promised to remain on the streets until their concerns , including opposition to the increasingly unpopular government and worry over economic issues , are addressed .
throughout most of the day , the capital had appeared calmer than in the past week .
christmas shoppers cautiously returned to central athens earlier on saturday , but many stores had boarded up their windows instead of replacing the glass , for fear of further violence .
much of the rioting has been blamed on an anarchist fringe tapping into resentment over political scandals and the impact of the global slowdown .
