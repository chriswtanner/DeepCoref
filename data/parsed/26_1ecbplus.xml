vincent gigante , mafia leader who feigned insanity , dies at 77 .
published : december 19 , 2005 .
vincent gigante , who feigned mental illness for decades to camouflage his position as one of the nation's most influential and dangerous mafia leaders , died today in federal prison in springfield , mo . , officials told the associated press .
he was 77 .
mr . gigante died while serving a 12 - year sentence imposed in 1997 after he was convicted of racketeering and conspiring to kill other mobsters .
officials at the prison medical center where he died did not provide the cause of death but noted that he suffered from heart disease .
mr . gigante , whose nickname was "chin , " painstakingly maintained the fiction that he was incompetent until april 2003 , when he appeared before judge i . leo glasser in federal district court in brooklyn and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice .
specifically , he acknowledged running a con on the legal system that delayed his racketeering trial from 1990 to 1997 while his sanity was being examined .
as part of the plea , three more years were added to his prison term , but he avoided a lengthy trial on the other charges , which amounted to an accusation - long denied or sidestepped by mr . gigante - that he headed the genovese organized crime family .
his lawyer , benjamin brafman , offered the explanation that "i think you get to a point in life - i think everyone does - where you become too old and too sick and too tired to fight . " .
for mr . gigante , the guise that he adopted in the mid - 1960's - behavior that won him the nickname oddfather - took considerable effort to maintain .
he could often be seen shuffling around his greenwich village neighborhood in pajamas , bathrobe and slippers , mumbling to himself and appearing to be a disturbed but harmless person .
law - enforcement agents , prosecutors and mafia defectors described his behavior as a staged performance calculated to evade prosecution for his activities as head of a crime family that under his leadership became the wealthiest and most powerful in the nation .
based on information from informers and electronic eavesdropping on gangsters , f . b . i . and new york city law - enforcement officials ranked mr . gigante as the pre - eminent mafia leader in the early and mid - 1990's , and prosecutors identified him as the dominant force in the early 1990's inside the commission , the mafia's ruling body , which resolves significant disputes among the five major families in the new york region .
his reach , law - enforcement officials said , extended as well to philadelphia and new england , where he exercised veto power over the appointments of mob bosses in those areas .
salvatore gravano , the no . 2 figure in the gambino crime family before he defected in 1991 , testified that even mr . gigante's archrival , john gotti , grudgingly acknowledged mr . gigante's craftiness .
"he's crazy like a fox , " mr . gravano quoted mr . gotti as saying of mr . gigante after a summit meeting of new york city mob leaders in 1988 .
mr . gotti was the boss of the gambino family until his own imprisonment forced him to relinquish undisputed control in the late 1990's .
he , too , died in a prison hospital , of cancer in june 2002 .
federal bureau of investigation agents and federal and state prosecutors regarded mr . gigante as the most elusive mafia leader of his era and the most difficult to bring to trial .
"he was probably the most clever organized - crime figure i have ever seen , " said john s . pritchard 3rd , a former f . b . i . supervisor , who led a squad that investigated the genovese family in the 1980's .
disputing the government's contentions , mr . gigante's lawyers and relatives maintained that he had been mentally disabled since the late 1960's , with a below - normal i . q . of 69 to 72 .
his defenders steadfastly denied that he was associated with the mafia , asserting that it was ludicrous to believe that someone so mentally subpar was capable of heading a major crime organization .
the rev . louis gigante , a roman catholic priest , former new york city councilman and a builder of low - income housing in the bronx , characterized the relentless investigations of his older brother as persecution by agents and prosecutors who were biased against italian - americans .
organized - crime experts and mob turncoats said that mr . gigante was apparently willing to humiliate himself publicly as the price for escaping the long prison sentences that were being meted out to other mafia leaders .
according to federal and state investigators , each of the family's 200 "made" or inducted soldiers and about 1 , 000 associates - the name for others who voluntarily cooperate in illegal activities but who are not sworn members - were obligated to funnel part of their loot to mr . gigante , as much as $100 million a year in the early 1990's .
the family's fortune , the experts said , flowed largely from a vast network of bookmaking and loansharking rings and from extortions of construction companies in the new york city area seeking labor peace or sweetheart contracts from carpenters , teamsters and laborers' unions that were dominated by mr . gigante's lieutenants .
mob deserters in the mid - 1990's testified in criminal and civil cases that the genovese gang's other lucrative enterprises included the control of cartels that rigged bids and inflated prices in the private garbage - hauling industries of new york city and westchester county ; kickbacks from shipping and trucking companies on the new jersey waterfront in exchange for labor peace ; protection payoffs from merchants at the fulton fish market ; and the control of many union jobs at the jacob k . javits convention center in manhattan .
mr . gigante's influence even extended over the san gennaro street festival in little italy until a 1995 crackdown by new york city officials and federal prosecutors resulted in allegations that the genovese family operated gambling games at the festival , extorted payoffs from venders and pocketed thousands of dollars donated to a neighborhood church .
in the 1980's , after the authorities said mr . gigante had assumed undisputed command of the genovese family , he conducted his activities in a starkly unorthodox fashion for a mafia leader .
most days , in the early evening , mr . gigante , a hulking man who was about six feet tall and weighed 200 pounds , would emerge from his mother's walkup apartment building on sullivan street in greenwich village .
sometimes dressed in a bathrobe and pajamas and sometimes wearing a windbreaker and shabby trousers and always accompanied by one or two bodyguards , he gingerly crossed the street to the triangle civic improvement association , a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters .
inside , he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with men who agents said were his trusted confederates .
after midnight , according to f . b . i . surveillance reports , he would be driven to a townhouse near park avenue at east 77th street , that was owned by olympia esposito , who was characterized by mr . gigante's lawyers as his common - law wife and the mother of three of his eight children , vincent , lucia and carmella esposito .
f . b . i . agents , who in 1986 observed the townhouse from a nearby rooftop post , said that soon after arriving , mr . gigante would change into more elegant clothes , carry on conversations with associates , and read or watch television before retiring .
about 9 or 10 the next morning , he would reappear in his shabby downtown clothes and be driven back to sullivan street or a nearby apartment occupied by his relatives at 505 laguardia place .
"it was hard to understand what enjoyment he got out of being a mob boss , " said ronald goldstock , the former director of the new york state organized crime task force .
"his only pleasure appeared to be the pure power he exercised . " .
vincent gigante ( pronounced ji - gant - tee ) was born on march 29 , 1928 , in new york city and grew up on the same streets in greenwich village where he would spend most of his adult life .
he was one of five sons of salvatore gigante , a watchmaker , and yolanda gigante , a seamstress , both of whom had immigrated from naples .
his mother usually addressed him as "cincenzo , " a diminutive of vincente , and his boyhood friends shortened that into his lifelong nickname , "chin . " .
a lackadaisical student , mr . gigante graduated from p . s . 3 , an elementary school in greenwich village and dropped out of textile high school in manhattan in the ninth grade .
police detectives said that as a teen - ager , he became a prot�g� of vito genovese , who was a potent mafia leader in the united states and in italy from the 1930's to the 1960's and whose name still describes the organized - crime group he headed until his death in 1969 .
the gang was founded in the 1930's by one of the nation's most notorious criminals , charles ( lucky ) luciano , who was deported to italy and who died in 1962 .
mr . genovese is believed to have endeared himself to the gigantes when vincent was a boy with a loan to pay for surgery needed by mrs . gigante .
between age 17 and 25 , mr . gigante was arrested seven times on an array of charges : receiving stolen goods , possession of an unlicensed handgun , auto theft , arson and bookmaking .
most were dismissed or resolved by fines .
his only jail sentence in that period was 60 days for a gambling conviction .
when arrested in his early 20's , he listed his occupation as a tailor .
but as a strapping youth with quick fists , he was better known as a prize fighter .
mr . gigante , from age 16 to 19 , fought as a light heavyweight in clubs around town , winning 21 of 25 light - heavyweight bouts , according to nat fleischer's ring record book .
club boxers in those days fought four - and six - round contests in neighborhood arenas , usually getting a percentage of the tickets they themselves sold .
one of mr . gigante's managers was a greenwich village neighbor , thomas ( tommy ryan ) eboli , who later became the boss of the genovese family .
former new york city detectives who were assigned to organized - crime intelligence units said that mr . gigante earned his mafia spurs as an enforcer in the 1950's .
but his prominence in the underworld surged in 1957 , when mr . genovese wrested control of a mob family from frank costello , who had been a close friend of lucky luciano and meyer lansky and was one of the best - known underworld figures in america .
mr . costello retired abruptly as a boss after a gunman grazed his scalp with a bullet in the vestibule of his apartment building on central park west .
a doorman identified the 29 - year - old mr . gigante as the shooter , but mr . costello testified that he was unable to recognize his assailant and mr . gigante was acquitted in 1958 on charges of attempted murder .
a year later , he was convicted with mr . genovese in manhattan on federal charges of heroin trafficking .
mr . gigante , who listed his profession as the superintendent of a tenement on bleecker street , was sentenced to seven years in prison .
the sentencing judge said he would have imposed a longer sentence but was swayed by a flood of letters from residents of greenwich village and little italy attesting to mr . gigante's good character and his work on behalf of juveniles .
he was paroled after five years and detectives said that soon afterward he was promoted from soldier to the rank of capo , or captain , overseeing a group of mafia gangsters known as a crew , in greenwich village .
although his headquarters was in lower manhattan and he spent his nights farther uptown , mr . gigante had a home in old tappan , n . j . , where he lived with his wife , the former olympia grippa , and their three daughters and two sons .
they are yolanda fyfe , roseanne d'cola and rita gigante , and salvatore and andrew .
in 1969 , he was indicted in new jersey on a charge of conspiracy to bribe the entire five - member old tappan police force to alert him to surveillance operations by law enforcement agencies .
the accusation was dropped after mr . gigante's lawyers presented reports from psychiatrists that he was mentally unfit to stand trial .
mafia informers and defectors said that mr . gigante gained control of the genovese family in a peaceful transition in the early 1980's when the group's acting boss , philip lombardo , stepped down because of ill health , and mr . gigante's main rival , anthony salerno , was imprisoned for life on racketeering charges .
mr . salerno died in federal prison in 1992 .
as a new godfather , mr . gigante quickly imposed extraordinary security measures .
genovese soldiers and associates were forbidden to utter his name or nickname in conversations or telephone calls .
when references to him had to be made , capos and soldiers would silently point to their chins or form the letter "c" with their fingers .
mr . gigante was indicted in 1990 with 14 others on federal charges in brooklyn that they had conspired to rig bids and extort payoffs from contractors on multimillion - dollar contracts with the new york city housing authority to install windows .
at his arraignment , he appeared in court in his familiar pajamas and bathrobe and a peaked cap .
because of defense contentions that he was mentally and physically impaired , his case was severed from the other defendants and legal battles ensued for seven years over his competence to stand trial .
a superseding indictment in 1993 brought more serious accusations against him .
mr . gigante was charged with being the head of the genovese family and sanctioning the murders of six mobsters and conspiring to kill three others , including john gotti , the boss of the gambino family .
mr . gigante , the indictment asserted , wanted mr . gotti eliminated because he had violated mafia protocol by arranging the assassination of the previous gambino boss , paul castellano , without seeking mr . gigante's approval .
the evidence in both indictments stemmed mainly from deserters from the genovese and other mob families who entered the government's witness protection program .
at sanity hearings in march 1996 , mr . gravano of the gambino family , and alphonse d'arco , the former acting boss of another new york mafia organization , the lucchese crime family , testified that mr . gigante was lucid during top - level mafia meetings and that he had acknowledged to other gangsters that his eccentric behavior was a pretense .
mr . gigante's lawyers elicited testimony and reports from psychiatrists and psychologists that from 1969 to 1995 , he had been confined 28 times in hospitals for treatment of hallucinations and that he suffered from "dementia rooted in organic brain damage . " .
in august 1996 , judge eugene h . nickerson of federal district court in brooklyn ruled that mr . gigante was mentally competent to stand trial on murder and racketeering charges .
the judge found that at least until 1991 , mr . gigante had engaged in an "elaborate deception" with the help of his relatives to deceive psychiatrists about his condition .
before the trial began , mr . gigante , who had open - heart surgery in 1988 , had another cardiac operation in december 1996 , putting his fitness to stand trial in doubt once again .
mr . gigante had pleaded not guilty and had been free for years on $1 million bond .
during the monthlong trial in 1997 , a gaunt - looking mr . gigante sat in a wheelchair , looking blankly into space as witnesses testified and lawyers argued .
he did not testify .
after three days of deliberations , the jury on july 25 , 1997 , convicted him on charges of running multimillion - dollar rackets as the genovese family chief and of conspiring unsuccessfully in the late 1980's to murder mr . gotti and a genovese family defector .
but he was acquitted of ordering three other gangland slayings and the jury was deadlocked on accusations that he ordered four other murders .
imposing a sentence of 12 years - instead of a possible maximum of 27 years - and a $1 . 25 million fine , judge jack b . weinstein of federal district court in brooklyn reflected in december 1997 on mr . gigante's career .
"he is a shadow of his former self , " the judge said , "an old man finally brought to bay in his declining years after decades of vicious criminal tyranny . " .
