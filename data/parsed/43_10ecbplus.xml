amd buys seamicro , starts selling intel - based servers .
on march 1 , 2012 at 8 : 12 am .
in an unprecedented move that suggests that there might be life in the old dog yet , amd has acquired seamicro , a company that builds high - density , low - power servers using intel cpus .
the deal cost amd $334 million ( $281m in cash ) , a fairly sizable chunk of change when you consider that its yearly profits are usually around the $400 million mark .
if you haven " t heard of seamicro before , they " re essentially a silicon valley startup built around a technology called freedom fabric , an asic ( application - specific integrated circuit ) that allows a computer to be scaled down to a motherboard the size of a deck of playing cards .
these tiny computers ( each one containing an atom or xeon cpu , some dram , and the freedom fabric asic ) are then stacked together to form very - high - density servers ( pictured above ) .
these server bricks are just 10u in size , contain up to 768 cpus , and include four gigabit ethernet switches and a load balancer .
to achieve the same kind of processing power with conventional rackmount servers you would need two full racks ( 84u ! ) of dual - socket quad - core servers and network gear .
the seamicro server bricks use a quarter of the power , too , because the custom cpu - dram - asics contain absolutely no hardware cruft that leeches power .
in short , with energy prices increasing , data center real estate as costly as ever , and the web showing no signs of slowing down , seamicro servers are really rather desirable .
more than miniaturization , though , freedom fabric is also compatible with multiple instruction sets and allows for complete hardware virtualization ; both very desirable properties in this age of cloud computing .
but why did amd buy seamicro ?
as it stands , seamicro has a tight partnership with intel , and every seamicro server uses intel chips .
according to amd , seamicro will sell intel - based servers " for the foreseeable future , " but an opteron - based solution should arrive by the end of the year .
in all likelihood , amd probably sees seamicro as an excellent way of bolstering its presence in the incredibly lucrative ( and rapidly expanding ) server market .
with seamicro , amd can deal directly with companies looking for servers , cutting out the ( very profitable ) hp , dell , or ibm middle man .
the server space is one area that amd still seems to be able compete with intel and with freedom fabric amd might once again become a compelling choice .
