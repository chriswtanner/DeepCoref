williams' dui arrest just the latest for chargers .
team has program to address problem .
2 a . m . feb . 4 , 2009 .
two years ago , the chargers won an nfl special award for helping start a san diego program by which players who've been imbibing can call a private number for a ride home , an alternative to driving under the influence .
a former chargers fullback , lorenzo neal , was among the co - founders of the " safe ride solutions " program that since has been expanded to other nfl cities .
evidently , though , the drinking and driving problem hasn't been eradicated in san diego .
sunday , for the second time in less than four weeks , a chargers player was pulled over in the early - morning hours and arrested on suspicion of dui .
" it's disappointing to hear about the issue involving jamal williams , " said general manager a . j . smith in a news release issued by the team yesterday .
" we'll continue to monitor the situation and let the legal process run its course . " .
smith's statement served as the only comment from the chargers .
a request to interview club president dean spanos was declined by a spokesman .
as it is , the chargers are still awaiting the disposition of a similar case involving wide receiver vincent jackson , arrested jan . 6 in clairemont on suspicion of driving under the influence .
jackson , also facing charges of driving while on probation for a prior dui , has an arraignment set for feb . 17 in san diego superior court .
williams , a three - time pro bowl nose tackle , was stopped for speeding westbound on state route 94 at approximately 1 : 30 a . m sunday .
arrested by the chp on suspicion of drunken driving , he was booked into county jail and later released on bond .
results of williams' blood - alcohol test have not been released .
" these are just two more arrests that we've had , " said pat hodgkin , local executive director of mothers against drunk driving ( madd ) , noting that roughly 13 , 000 dui convictions are issued every year in san diego county .
" however , these are media - worthy professionals .
these are individuals that not only youth looks up to , but adults look up to as well .
they need to understand that they have an effect on people and a responsibility . " .
the chargers were involved in one of the most publicized and bizarre instances of a dui stop in 2006 .
linebacker steve foley was shot three times by an off - duty coronado police officer who followed foley from downtown to the player's home in poway .
foley , his career ended by the bullet wounds , later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor dui .
it was that case that prompted gary lawrence , a detective with the northern division of the san diego police department , to ally with the chargers in a program in which players who've been drinking would call " safe ride solutions " and be driven home by an off - duty member of law enforcement .
" anytime anybody's arrested for dui , i get very disappointed , and not just when athletes are involved , " said lawrence yesterday .
" we're talking about a crime where people are killed or injured , a crime where people go to jail , and it's 100 percent preventable . " .
citing his company's confidentiality agreement with clients , lawrence declined to discuss anything specific pertaining to the chargers and their players .
from its start with the team , though , the business has grown to include clients from other high - profile realms and put to work by other nfl franchises .
in recognition of the program , the league gave the chargers its winston - shell award in 2007 for " demonstrating commitment and dedication to developing unique and innovative ideas and solutions . " .
