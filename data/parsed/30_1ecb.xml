severed cables bring down phone lines linking europe , asia , mideast .
internet and telephone communications between europe , the middle east and asia were severely disrupted friday after three undersea cables were damaged in the mediterranean , france telecom said .
" the causes of the cut , which is located in the mediterranean between sicily and tunisia , on sections linking sicily to egypt , remain unclear , " a statement said , while a spokesman said it was unlikely to have been an attack .
the company said it was sending a ship to fix the lines but that it would not arrive until monday and that it could take until december 31 before normal service was restored .
most business-to-business traffic between europe and asia was being rerouted through the united states , the firm said , but regular communications between europe and several asian countries has been disrupted since early friday .
sixty-five per cent of traffic to india was down , while services to singapore , malaysia , saudi arabia , egypt , taiwan and pakistan were also severely affected , a spokesman said friday evening .
an afternoon toll released by france telecom said that 100 percent of traffic was lost in the maldives indian ocean islands , with the gulf state of qatar and djibouti , on the gulf of aden , also losing over 70 percent of their traffic .
egypt 's state news agency mena reported that the cuts happened off the coast of sicily at 10:00 am ( 0800 gmt ) on friday , with indian-registered reliance globalcom directing a submarine cable repair company to head to the region to fix the cables .
the agency added that services were being rerouted to backup cables and satellites to compensate for the failures .
the cables are jointly owned by several dozen different countries .
one of the cables is 40,000 kilometres ( 25,000 miles ) long and links 33 different countries while a second is 20,000 kilometres long and serves 14 states .
" if there was just one cable down we could have used the other two , " said france telecom spokesman louis-michel aymard .
" but all three are down so this puts us in a very difficult situation .
" this is a very rare situation , " he said .
the cables might have got caught up in trawlers ' nets or there may have been an underwater landslide , said aymard .
one appeared to be fully severed , while the other two seemed to be only partially cut , he added .
each cable has a " leader " country , he said. egypt is in charge of the main cable and in this capacity commissioned france telecom marine , a subsidiary of the communications giant , to handle the repairs .
the boat , with 20 kilometres ( 12.5 miles ) of spare cable on board , will leave very early saturday and arrive monday .
in january , five cables in the middle east and europe were cut , causing internet failures in the region and damaging traffic through the region 's important call centre industry .
france telecom said it would publish updates on its website on the latest traffic disruption .
traffic from europe to algeria and tunisia is not affected , it said .
