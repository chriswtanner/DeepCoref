previously , turkmenistan had a people 's council whose 2,507 members had to be approved by the country 's late ruler , saparmurat niyazov , who died in 2006 after 21 years in power .
the new leader , mr berdymukhamedov , a former dentist , has introduced a number of measures to modernise the gas-rich nation , after years of isolation under his predecessor .
abolishing the people 's council and reinstating the country 's parliament was one of them .
