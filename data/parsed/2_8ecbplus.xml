comedian ellen degeneres will make her second appearance as an academy awards host next year , organizers said on friday , in a move widely seen as a less provocative choice for hollywood's highest honors after a ribald performance by seth macfarlane .
degeneres , the star of her own daytime talk show "ellen , " first hosted the oscars in 2007 , becoming only the second woman to fill that exalted role alone , after whoopi goldberg .
"i am so excited to be hosting the oscars for the second time , " degeneres said in a statement .
"you know what they say - the third time's the charm . " .
"i'd like to thank @theacademy , my wife portia and , oh dear , there goes the orchestra , " the comedian added on twitter .
degeneres , 55 , earned an emmy nomination for her performance in 2007 in which she departed from traditional oscar hosting decorum and ventured into the audience for spot gags , at one point handing director martin scorsese a script of her own .
"choosing degeneres , known for her kindler , gentler humor , signals that the academy's next awards show will have a decidedly different tone than the 85th academy awards , " trade magazine the hollywood reporter wrote .
degeneres also earned praise for her performance as the host of tv's emmy awards in 2001 , which was twice delayed because of the september 11 attacks , memorably lightening the somber mood by asking , "what would bug the taliban more than seeing a gay woman in a suit surrounded by jews ? " .
the announcement of degeneres as host also comes on the heels of hollywood marketing executive cheryl boone isaacs being elected as the first african american president of the 6 , 000 - member academy , which has made an effort to diversify its ranks after coming under fire for being too male , old and white .
trade publication variety saw the choice of degeneres as a continuation of the academy's "year of the woman , " writing that the oscars "will put women in the driver's seat . " .
