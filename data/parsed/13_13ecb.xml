the wasilla bible church in wasilla , alaska was apparently attacked by an arsonist last night .
the fire , which broke out when several people were inside the church , did an estimated $ 1 million damage .
authorities described the fire as " suspicious and as potential arson . " .
the bible church 's head minister said , " someone intentionally did it , but we do n't know who and why . " .
he declined to say whether the church has received threats .
governor palin stopped by the church this morning and " told an assistant pastor that she apologizes if the incident is in any way connected to the undeserved negative attention the church has received since she became a vice presidential candidate . " .
given the insane hatred that democrats directed toward palin during the recent campaign , it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that the arson is the work of a liberal democrat .
but we do n't know that for sure .
there are many possible motives , and arsonists do n't necessarily need what would normally be regarded as a motive .
it would be a good thing for the country if this particular crime does not turn out to be politically motivated .
