jackson arrested on dui charge .
despite his arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence early yesterday , chargers receiver vincent jackson will play in sunday 's afc divisional playoff game at pittsburgh .
jackson , 25 , was driving east on state route 52 near interstate 805 just after 2:30 a.m. when he was pulled over for an observed traffic violation , california highway patrol officer brad baehr said .
jackson faces the misdemeanor dui allegation as well as charges that he was driving on probation for a prior dui in june 2006 , baehr said .
the results of a blood test are pending .
jackson proffered his innocence in a statement released yesterday afternoon .
" this morning i was stopped by an officer , " jackson said in the statement .
" i do n't think any charges will be filed as a result of the stop .
in the event they are , i look forward to clearing my name and proving my innocence . " .
the arrest will not affect jackson 's status for sunday 's game .
the nfl 's collective bargaining agreement gives the league , not teams , authority to punish players for alcohol and substance abuses .
any discipline by the league would be meted out for the 2009 season , several sources said .
a suspension certainly is possible .
the nfl 's substance-abuse policy states : " discipline for a second or subsequent offense is likely to be a suspension , the duration of which may escalate for repeat offenses . " .
jared allen , then with kansas city , was suspended for the first four games of the 2007 season after being charged with dui twice in one year .
the nfl later reduced his suspension to two games .
chargers players had the day off yesterday .
general manager a.j. smith issued the following statement on jackson 's arrest .
" we 're aware of the off-the-field issue involving vincent .
obviously , we 're disappointed .
we take these issues very seriously .
moving forward , we will monitor the situation and have no further comment . " .
jackson was driving a 2008 gmc sierra registered to him , baehr said .
he was booked into county jail and was released by 6 a.m. , baehr said .
jackson , in his fourth season , caught a career-high 59 passes and led the team with 1,098 yards , also a career high .
his seven receiving touchdowns were also a career best and second on the team .
earlier this week , smith called jackson a " true professional " and " ultimate team player " for how hard jackson played even while not catching any passes .
" you win championships with players like vincent jackson , " smith said .
the general manager has put an emphasis on character and avoiding off-the-field issues .
the chargers have not had any arrests become public this season and have been relatively trouble-free in recent years .
in 2006 , linebacker steve foley was shot by an off-duty coronado policeman who suspected foley of driving under the influence .
foley pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drunken driving and was placed on five years ' probation .
in july , he settled a lawsuit against the city of coronado for $ 5.5 million .
jackson 's contract runs through 2009 , and he is among the hottest young receivers in the league .
what becomes of this incident , combined with the previous dui , could affect jackson 's long-term future with the chargers .
smith has let go a number of players who have had off-the-field troubles .
while none was as productive or possessed the upside of jackson , smith did last february release tackle shane olivea just two years after signing olivea to a contract that guaranteed him $ 9 million .
olivea later underwent treatment for an addiction to pain killers .
" you 're a charger one year at a time , " smith has often said .
recently , speaking of the lack of incidents involving his players , smith said , " it 's very important if you want to be a charger you do the right things on and off the field . " .
the chargers leave friday for pittsburgh , where they will face the steelers at 1:45 p.m. sunday .
