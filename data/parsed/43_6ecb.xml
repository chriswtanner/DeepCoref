graphic talk about nvidia .
addressing a deficiency of its own and further upping the competitive tension between it and chief rival intel ( nasdaq : intc - news - people ) , advanced micro devices ( nyse : amd - news - people ) intends to acquire graphics chipmaker ati technologies ( nasdaq : atyt - news - people ) in a $ 5.4 billion deal .
is intel below $ 19 too cheap to last or still above what the chipmaker 's worth ?
the question for many is where that leaves nvidia corp. ( nasdaq : nvda - news - people ) , now the sole independent graphics chip maker addressing each of the computing , mobile communications and display markets .
we think not too much worse off than before the deal , and believe shares in the company remain a compelling way to play growth in gaming- and media-oriented computing .
our view of the advanced micro devices / ati technologies deal is that it 's the last major move amd needed to make to match intel 's breadth in the processor market ( now that intel has shed its communications processor business ) .
intel has had for some time the ability to integrate graphics capabilities into its offerings for pc makers , resources for which amd has had to rely on other folks , including both ati and nvidia .
the amd/ati combination now trumps intel 's strategy by adding the capacity to package higher-end chips for gaming and complex graphic manipulation .
we 're not sure that 's a huge game-changer for ati in its ongoing match against nvidia , though .
we doubt amd would shut out nvidia 's ability to integrate with its core processors , as any such move might lessen the attractiveness of amd 's core products to that crowd .
