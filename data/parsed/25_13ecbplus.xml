pierre thomas and chris ivory are out .
deshawn wynn and joique bell are in .
suddenly , the no . 5 saints don " t look as quite as big a threat to make a repeat trip to the super bowl .
one day after chris ivory was surprisingly lost for the season , the saints placed thomas on injured reserve .
the team " s best running back also sat out in week 17 .
coach sean payton said thomas suffered a setback in practice last week .
we " ve been toying with the idea of picking the saints to make it back to the super bowl .
they " ve turned the ball over too much , but their defense is a lot better than people think .
this news makes it harder .
it " s going to be a lot harder for the new orleans offense to stay balanced with reggie bush and julius jones carrying the load .
wynn and bell were added to the roster in the last two days , but figure to be reserves .
