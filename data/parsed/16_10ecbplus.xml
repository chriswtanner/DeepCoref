judge sentences orozco to death .
posted : 05 / 02 / 07 , 9 : 00 pm pdt | .
a norwalk superior court judge on thursday upheld a jury's recommendation that convicted cop killer jose luis orozco die for his crimes .
judge philip hickok told a packed courtroom that he weighed all the aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances in the ambush slaying of los angeles county sheriff's deputy jerry ortiz in june 2005 , and he concluded that the case "absolutely warrants death instead of life without parole . " .
orozco was convicted march 20 of first - degree murder for the slaying of ortiz , a 15 - year veteran and member of the anti - gang detail at the sheriff's lakewood station .
a jury recommended on april 3 that orozco be executed .
wearing the orange los angeles county jail - issued jumpsuit and with his handcuffed wrists chained to his waist , orozco smiled as he was led from the courtroom for the last time and turned to make an obscene gesture at a photographer .
in denying an automatic motion by the defense to reduce the jury's recommendation from death to life in prison without the possibility of parole , hickok called the slaying of the newlywed deputy and father of two "a cold - blooded , vicious murder . " .
'colossal' factors .
hickok said the aggravating factors in the case were "colossal . " .
he noted the 29 - year - old gang member not only killed the deputy while hiding outside of the lawman's view behind a door , orozco also allegedly tried to kill another man just a few days earlier by shooting that individual in the back twice , and had bragged about killing the officer .
he had also boasted prior to ortiz's killing that he wanted to kill a cop , that he wanted to make a name for his gang , the judge added .
"the murder was committed without regard in front of two extremely impressionable and young girls , " hickok said , referring to the star witnesses in the case , two sisters - 8 - and 10 - year - old girls - who described the shooting for the jury .
" ( orozco ) arranged to have witnesses , including those two very young girls , killed so that they would not testify , " hickok said .
dozens of deputies - many in uniform - packed the court for thursday's sentencing , just as they had every day of the trial .
in the center of the gallery was the slain deputy's wife , chela ortiz , who linked hands with her mother - in - law , rosa ortiz , and her husband's siblings .
chela spoke briefly before hickok made the final ruling , addressing her husband's killer directly as she read from a letter written by her stepson , jeremy ortiz , and then made her own statement .
"why did you do it ?
why did you have to stand behind a door like a coward ? " the young widow read from the teen's letter .
chela ortiz , who married the deputy three weeks before he was murdered , told orozco in a firm voice , "i want you to know you did not break our family , " as her family began to cry .
"our jerry is in heaven , we will see him again . . .
his memory will live on , " she said amid the sounds of soft sobs and sniffles .
"and you will always be remembered as a coward . " .
the 35 - year - old deputy was killed on june 24 , while investigating an attack in which orozco shot a man in the back while doing yard work at a hawaiian gardens home four days earlier .
along with murder , orozco was convicted of one count of attempted murder involving the earlier shooting and two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon .
jurors also found true the special circumstance allegations of murder of a peace officer , murder while lying in wait and murder to avoid arrest , along with the allegations that he personally discharged a handgun and committed the crimes for the benefit of a criminal street gang .
in addition to asking the judge to reduce the sentence thursday , orozco's attorneys made a motion for a new trial , arguing that the da was wrongly allowed to bring in overwhelmingly prejudicial material about orozco's gang ties .
the attorneys also argued that the defense was hamstrung when the judge refused to let them bring in the rev . gregory boyle to testify on his gang experience in the penalty phase of the trial .
they said the judge also refused to let them add jury instructions about others who could be guilty of aiding and abetting orozco .
prosecutors pointed out all those arguments had been made during the guilt or penalty phase of the trial , and the judge had already ruled in the matters .
hickok agreed and denied both motions .
'tragic situation' .
outside court , defense attorney stanley perlo said his client stands little chance at winning an appeal in the state supreme court , which he described as "very pro death . " .
in the ninth district court of appeals , there is a chance they will see that the defense was denied a key witness in the penalty phase of the trial , he said .
neither perlo nor his co - counsel , robin yanes , ever claimed their client's innocence .
their client had committed the crimes , both attorneys said thursday .
rather , they argued that the defendant's lifetime of gang membership and drug abuse were mitigating factors that could not be ignored and that should have spared him death .
they added that many of the people called to testify against their client were equally responsible for the deputy's slaying and yet were not prosecuted .
"it's a tragic situation with nothing but a sad ending .
what else could it be ? " yanes said .
asked about the pending appeal , deputy district attorney phil stirling said such cases can never be predicted , but added that he and lowell anger - the lead da on the case - were confident the conviction and sentence would stand .
after the sentencing , stirling called orozco a "predator . " .
"he is a killer .
he murdered deputy sheriff jerry ortiz , in addition to attempting to murder at least three other people that we know of , " stirling said .
orozco's death sentence will be automatically appealed to the california supreme court and he was ordered to be transferred within 10 days from county jail to san quentin state prison , where he will await his appeal on death row .
"he'll probably live a much longer , healthier life on death row than he would have on the streets , " perlo said .
