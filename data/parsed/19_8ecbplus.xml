an nypd spokesperson confirmed to mailonline that there was a ‘ large disorderly group throwing bottles at police . " .
they said the protest began around 8 : 30pm tonight but the crowd is being dispersed by police .
new york city councilman jumaane d . williams , who represents the area of flatbush , has been tweeting live updates , and said : ‘ i " m in the middle of the riot action at church and snyder in my district .
right now , things are tense .
young people have expressed anger . " .
mr williams later described the scene of chaos in flatbush , saying that garbage cans had been overturned and people smashed out windows .
he added that one person had been attacked outside of a local rite aid .
‘ tonight was a peaceful vigil that devolved into a riot , " he wrote .
‘ the youth in this community have no outlets for their anger , no community . " .
another twitter user who is apparently at the site said that the riot 'sounds like a war zone . ' .
a source told the new york daily news that the protest began some 20 blocks from where gray was fatally shot .
the march went past the 67th presinct station , where officers impeded the protest " s progress .
that " s when the peaceful protest got out of hand .
the unnamed nypd officer told the daily news that they saw teens jumping on cars and throwing bottles at officers .
gray , 16 , was shot eleven times after police said he pulled out a . 357 revolver in east flatbush , brooklyn over the weekend .
police say they came across a group of young men on saturday evening and saw gray acting suspiciously , walking away from his friends when he saw the officers approach .
officers say the 16 - year old began to adjust his waistband and started to act suspiciously .
gray then turned around and pointed a . 357 caliber gun at them , according to police accounts .
when the two plainclothes officers saw the weapon they responded by opening fire .
the teen was rushed to kings county hospital but he later died .
however , witnesses to the shooting say that the nypd's account is wrong .
gray " s older sister , mahnefah gray , 19 , told the new york times that one of the witnesses of the shooting told her that her brother was only fixing his belt .
she added that her brother had too much ‘ common sense " to point a loaded gun at an officer , and doubted that he was even carrying a gun at all .
a woman who lives across the street from the scene of the shooting told the times that gray was calling out : ‘ please don " t let me die ! " and said the officers yelled back : ‘ stay down , or we " ll shoot you again . " .
grey lived in nearby crown heights , but had grown up in east flatbush and returned there to visit friends .
his older brother , jamar , was killed in a car accident two years ago .
according to witnesses , when the two cops arrived on the scene in an unmarked car , gray was part of a group of six teenagers standing by the side of the road .
one of gray's friends , devonte brown told the new york post : 'as the cops opened fire , he was screaming , ‘ stop !
i " m not running ! " .
his friends have not explained exactly what caused the police officers to shoot .
police say gray's gun was loaded with four bullets but have not yet determined whether the teenager fired his weapon .
gray had been in trouble with the law before , having been arrested three times since october and had previously been charged with grand larceny and inciting a riot .
