greek anti - austerity march erupts in violence , 3 dead .
wed may 5 , 2010 7 : 12pm bst .
three people , one of them a pregnant woman , were killed when greeks protesting against government austerity measures threw petrol bombs at a bank in athens on wednesday .
tens of thousands of striking workers and civil servants took to the streets and masked youths clashed with police in riot gear , who responded with steady rounds of tear gas and flash bombs which clouded the city centre .
it was the worst violence to hit greece since riots in 2008 .
the violence was a blow to prime minister george papandreou's plans to push through tough budget cuts demanded by the european union and international monetary fund in exchange for a 110 billion euro ( 93 . 6 billion pound ) aid package unveiled on sunday .
police said two women and one man , between 30 and 40 years old , working for a marfin bank branch choked on smoke after protesters broke the windows of a commercial building on central stadiou avenue and tossed in molotov cocktails .
marfin bank officials told reuters one of the female victims was pregnant .
firemen had to restrain a distraught elderly woman outside the bank , who wept and cried "my child , my child . " .
papandreou expressed shock at the deaths and vowed to bring those responsible to justice .
"we are deeply shocked by the unjust death of these three people , our fellow citizens , who were victims of a murderous act , " he told parliament .
he also defended his austerity plans , which foresee 30 billion euros in savings mainly from cuts in wages and pensions , and said the government would not abandon its drive to save the country from ruin .
"we took these decisions to save the country , " he said .
"the alternative would be bankruptcy . " .
biggest protest .
protesters tried to storm parliament but were pushed back by riot police shortly before it started to debate the austerity bill .
opposition conservatives are refusing to support it , but the government , which enjoys a comfortable majority , hopes to pass it by the end of the week .
police put the march , to mark a 24 - hour nationwide strike , at roughly 30 , 000 people .
but witnesses said there were more than 50 , 000 - - easily the biggest protest since papandreou took office last october and launched efforts to reform an economy that is uncompetitive and plagued by corruption .
hundreds of black - hooded anarchists roamed the streets , smashing store windows and hacking chunks of marble off buildings to throw at police .
although they were behind the worst of the violence , other protesters joined them in pelting police with bottles , shouting "thieves ! " .
presidential guards , who usually stand immobile in front of the assembly building , left their posts as the clashes worsened .
"our country is on the edge of the abyss , " greek president karolos papoulias said in a statement .
"we are all responsible so that it does not take the step into the void . " .
the marchers had dispersed by late afternoon , leaving streets littered with burnt out garbage containers .
dozens of shop windows were smashed , including a bookstore near the burnt bank .
two other buildings besides the bank were set on fire .
police said 18 people had been injured in the violence and 12 arrested for carrying weapons and resisting authorities .
blow to government .
the eu and imf aid was intended to calm markets and give the government time to overhaul the economy and bring down a deficit that totalled 13 . 6 percent of national economic output last year .
but the euro currency and greek assets have been pummelled by concern that social unrest could thwart government plans to push through the measures , and on fears that greece's woes could spread to other euro zone countries such as portugal and spain .
in past months anti - austerity protests had been fairly peaceful , but wednesday's violence was similar to that seen in the december 2008 riots , which broke out when police killed a teenager and dragged on for weeks .
wednesday's strike grounded flights , shut shops and brought public transport to a standstill and the main public sector union adedy said it was planning more walkout for next week .
"the big participation in the strike today and the crowds that flooded the streets of athens . . . sent a message to the government : we will not let the eu and the imf measures pass , " said ilias vrettakos , deputy head of the union .
apostolos kolokythopoulos , a 70 - year old pensioner who lives on less than 1 , 000 euros a month , said the walkouts were needed to force the government to change course .
"i agree with the strikes .
if people don't react , don't protest , how will things change ? " he said .
centre - left daily eleftherotypia warned young greeks would rise up if nothing was done to give them hope of a future .
"if nothing is done , the explosion of the angry and the disappointed will sweep everything away , " the paper said .
"have we forgotten december 2008 and become complacent ? " .
