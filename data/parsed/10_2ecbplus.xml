boston red sox majority owner john w . henry , ceo larry lucchino and general manager theo epstein flew to texas on thursday night to meet with free agent mark teixeira and his agent , scott boras , in an effort to convince the switch - hitting first baseman to sign with boston .
the red sox have made an eight - year offer to teixeira in excess of $160 million , but sources close to the negotiations say it is less than the $184 million reported by boston wcvb sportscaster mike lynch , who first reported that the meeting would take place .
the meeting will not result in a " take it or leave it " scenario by the red sox , a source said .
however , henry said earlier this week that the red sox will not satisfy boras " request for a 10 - year deal , and it appears highly unlikely that boston will go beyond eight years .
the parties are meeting at an undisclosed location in texas , the red sox having requested the face - to - face meeting with the player so he can hear directly from them why they believe he should spend the next eight years in boston .
the los angeles angels , baltimore orioles and washington nationals also have made offers to teixeira , but to date none of those offers are believed to be for more than eight years .
yankees general manager brian cashman also met with teixeira earlier this month , but that was before the yankees committed more than $240 million to sign pitchers cc sabathia and a . j . burnett , so it appears unlikely they would make a grab for teixeira as well .
boras also represents free - agent catcher jason varitek , the red sox captain who declined an offer of salary arbitration from the team .
boston has not made another offer to varitek since , though the sides continue to talk .
a third boras client , free - agent pitcher derek lowe , also is of interest to the red sox , but they have not made him an offer and are expected to do so only if he drops his price .
lowe is believed to be seeking a five - year deal in the $75 million range .
teixeira , who turns 29 on april 11 , has averaged more than 30 home runs and 100 rbis in his six big - league seasons , while posting a . 919 ops and playing gold glove - caliber defense .
the red sox envision him as a middle - of - the - lineup presence to offset last july " s departure of manny ramirez to the dodgers .
if teixeira signs with the red sox , they would move all - star kevin youkilis from first to third base while looking to trade third baseman mike lowell , the 2007 world series mvp .
