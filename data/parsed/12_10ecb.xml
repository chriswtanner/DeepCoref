the indian navy has captured 23 somalian pirates .
the pirates were about to board a vessel in the gulf of aden when they were apprehended .
last month , india 's navy drew criticism after sinking a thai fishing trawler that had been commandeered hours earlier by pirates , but the navy says it fired in self-defence .
somali pirates have become increasingly brazen , and recently seized a saudi supertanker loaded with e75m worth of crude oil .
