deep throat suspect found dead in hotel .
thursday 29 july 2004 08 . 23 bst .
one of the longest - running mysteries of american politics may soon be resolved after it was announced yesterday that the man many suspect of being deep throat in the watergate scandal had died .
fred larue , known as the "bagman" because he delivered payments to ensure the silence of participants in the watergate break - in , was found dead in a hotel room in biloxi , mississippi .
he was 75 .
the two washington post reporters who broke the watergate story , carl bernstein and bob woodward , have maintained that they would only reveal the identity of deep throat once he was dead .
although there have been several names advanced as deep throat , larue is one of the more likely candidates .
he was a special assistant to john mitchell , the former attorney general who headed creep , the campaign to re - elect the president , in 1972 .
larue was at a meeting at nixon's florida holiday home at which the scheme to break into the democratic headquarters in the watergate building in washington was first mooted .
although larue insisted he was not deep throat , and that the source was a combination of several people , woodward and bernstein have insisted deep throat was one person .
larue said last year that president nixon had not been told of the plan to break into the building .
he cited his close relationship with mr mitchell to back up his claim that the president was ignorant of the plan .
larue served four and a half months in prison for his role in the watergate conspiracy , after being charged with obstructing justice .
