the united nations on wednesday denied israel defense forces claims that there were palestinian militants in the gaza school bombed by israel on tuesday .
christopher gunness of the un relief and works agency ( unrwa ) said the organization is 99.9 percent certain there were no militants or military activity in its school .
that does not necessarily contradict israel 's claim that the militants were operating close by , gunness said .
gunness put the death toll of the shelling at 40 , and added that the agency wants an impartial investigation of witnesses , israeli military photographs or any other evidence .
the idf on tuesday released video footage from 2007 showing palestinian militants firing from the school compound and carrying a rocket launcher with them as they flee the scene .
