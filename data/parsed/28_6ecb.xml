the former fbi second-in-command who revealed himself as " deep throat " 30 years after he tipped off reporters to the watergate scandal that toppled a president has died .
mark felt was 95. john d. o'connor , a family friend who wrote the 2005 vanity fair article uncovering felt 's secret , says he died thursday .
the shadowy central figure in one of the most gripping political dramas of the 20th century , felt insisted his alter ego be kept secret when he leaked damaging information about president richard nixon and his aides to the washington post .
some speculated that felt was the source who connected the white house to the june 1972 break-in at the headquarters of the democratic national committee .
he steadfastly denied the accusations until finally coming forward in may 2005 .
in the last week of november , the national archives released more than 10,000 pages of documents from the nixon presidency , among them were the urgings of past and present fbi agents and other interested citizens to appoint felt , then the no. 2 fbi official , as director .
associates described his " outstanding loyalty . " .
nixon did not take the advice .
ultimately , felt 's devastating leaks as the washington post 's secret watergate source helped undermine nixon 's presidency .
nixon , soon to be consumed by the watergate investigation , passed over career agents including felt when he selected loyalist l. patrick gray as fbi chief after the j. edgar hoover 's death in 1972 , just weeks before the watergate break-in .
gray resigned the next year because of allegations he had destroyed watergate documents .
felt 's supporters weighed in , with letters , telegrams and cards that have been in nixon 's white house files all these years .
" he has the integrity , the ability , the experience and the image to insure that our fbi will continue to deserve and maintain world esteem , " harold l. child jr. , legal attache to the embassy in japan and a 30-year fbi veteran , told nixon in an april 1973 letter .
efton a. stanfield , a former fbi special agent who was then an executive of the electrical contractors ' association , asked nixon in a telegram to turn to the career professional to replace gray .
" mr. felt is a man of outstanding loyalty , character , reputation , habits , " he said .
the " fidelity , bravery , and integrity of mr. felt are unquestioned . " .
felt himself was the lead agent in a telegram sent to the white house by a group of agents asking that a highly qualified professional be nominated .
the police chief in kodiak , alaska , made the case for felt , and so did ordinary citizens .
writing from brooklyn , n.y. , viena k. neaville told nixon that choosing felt would be good for him because , " you would be spared the tremendous aggravation to which you are subjected by so many factions . " .
nixon was spared no grief .
he eventually chose william ruckelshaus , who served at fbi only briefly .
deep throat 's identity remained a mystery until felt stepped forward in 2005 to acknowledge his clandestine role in bringing down nixon .
bob woodward of the washington post said he first spoke with felt about watergate two days after the break-in .
