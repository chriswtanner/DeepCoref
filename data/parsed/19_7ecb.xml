greek government under fire .
a week of violence in greece has taken its toll on the fragile conservative government , with opinion polls showing many think authorities mishandled the worst rioting in decades .
the shooting of a 15-year-old boy by police unleashed a wave of unrest by thousands of students and anarchists across the country .
this comes at a time where there is growing anger over political scandals and the impact of a global recession on greece 's economy .
while the violence has generally subsided in the past few days , small groups of hooded youngsters are still hurling fire bombs , smashing shops and fighting running battles with riot police .
prime minister costas karamanlis has pledged to ensure security , rebuffing calls for early elections .
an opinion poll published by ethnos newspaper on sunday said 83.3 percent of greeks were unhappy with the government 's response to the violence .
" i 'm tired of coming to the shop every night to check the damages .
you think it 's going to calm down and then it starts again. " said anna pavlidou , manager of a central athens mobile phone store that has been repeatedly attacked and looted .
" the government should assume its responsibilities and resign .
it did n't handle it well .
if it had , we would n't have 355 damaged shops in athens .
i mean we will not be able to open until christmas. " she said .
a policeman charged with killing alexandros grigoropoulos has been jailed along with a colleague pending trial , while more than 400 protesters have been detained over the unrest .
