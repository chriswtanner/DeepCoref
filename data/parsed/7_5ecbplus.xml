on jul 7 2012 , 5 : 55p .
wladimir klitschko won his 16th straight fight today , successfully defending the wba , wbo , and ibf heavyweight titles against tony thompson , stopping the 40 - year - old american in the sixth round of a fight that was never really close .
klitschko ( 58 - 3 , 51 ko ) bombed thompson with a vicious right hand in the fifth round , putting him down late in the frame .
that thompson got up spoke a lot about his desire to try and win , but the fight essentially ended there .
he survived the round , but by the end of the sixth frame , appeared mentally beaten and looking for a way out .
he went down again in the corner late in the round , and this time referee sam williams stopped it at 2 : 56 .
klitschko had beaten thompson back in 2008 , mostly dominating that fight and knocking "the tiger" out in the 11th rounds .
this time , with thompson four years older and having had no significant tests in the four years that had passed since their first bout , it wasn't even as competitive as it was the first time .
thompson ( 36 - 3 , 24 ko ) just didn't have a shot in there , looked old , and though his awkward southpaw style gave klitschko some moments of slight discomfort , it would be a stretch to say that he troubled wladimir .
at this point with the klitschkos , as much as i admire their talent , skill , dedication to their craft , and the classy manner in which they carry themselves , i just feel like i've seen enough from them both .
we're running rerun bouts now .
is there really anyone out there you can look at and see as an actual threat to them ? is there anyone on the way up who has that skill set ?
i just don't see it , and i've grown tired of tuning in for passionless exhibitions of superiority .
i don't think they've killed the division , i just think they've dominated it , and with no actual hope for that earth - shaking upset on the horizon , i think i'd personally prefer to just see them both take farewell fights and head on out .
there's nothing more to see here .
