internet and telephone traffic between europe and the middle east and asia was hampered friday after three major underwater data lines were cut , according to france telecom .
the cut occurred on lines between 07:28 and 08:06 coordinated universal time ( utc ) on lines in the mediterranean sea that connect sicily to tunisia and egypt , the telecommunications company said .
the cuts were to the sea me we 4 and sea me we 3 lines , which connect countries between singapore and france as well as the flag cable route , which stretches from the u.k. to japan , a france telecom spokeswoman who asked not to be named said .
france telecom is n't sure what caused the cut , she said .

" we have two assumptions .
the first is that it could be an underwater earthquake , " she said .
" or it could be simply a ship in the area which has cut the cable . " .

a maintenance boat is en route to the site of the cut , but it will not get there until monday , and it will take as many as two weeks for the situation to return to normal , she said .
many countries were affected by the outage , including india , saudi arabia , egypt and malaysia , which all lost a significant percentage on their voice traffic to europe .
for example , 82 percent of india 's voice traffic capability to europe was out of service early friday , although that situation has now improved , the spokeswoman said .
internet traffic also has been hit by the incident , according to danny mcpherson , chief security officer with arbor networks .
his company 's sensors reported that between 3,000 and 5,000 internet routes in the region were off-line early friday morning .
these routes are the internet 's equivalent of dialing prefixes , meaning that computers that used them would be completely unreachable until service was restored .
" it 's significant that it was lost , " he said .
" for them it was in the middle of a business day on friday . " .
a large number of these came back on-line around 17:00 utc , mcpherson said .
most likely this happened after isps ( internet service providers ) that had been knocked off-line had found alternate routes for their traffic .
it 's hard to estimate how many internet users were affected by the cut , but the internet has a total of close to 300,000 such routes , he said .
this is not the first time this year that these cables have been cut .
earlier this year both the sea me we 4 and flag cables were cut .
flag 's cable was reportedly cut by ships anchored off the coast of alexandria , egypt .
