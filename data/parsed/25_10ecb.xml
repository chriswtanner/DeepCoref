new orleans saints rb reggie bush 's season over .
the associated press reports new orleans saints running back reggie bush ( knee ) will miss the rest of the season .
bush underwent an mri earlier this week , and head coach sean payton decided the team would place bush on injured reserve .
it has been a disappointing campaign for bush ; .
the 2006 second-overall pick played in just 10 games this year , rushing for 404 yards and two touchdowns while catching 52 passes for 440 yards and four scores .
however , he missed time because of arthroscopic knee surgery earlier this year and apparently a knee sprain will halt his season .
in bush 's absence this year , running back pierre thomas has established himself as a legitimate no. 1 back .
he has 189 rushing yards and two touchdowns in his last two games .
he has also caught eight passes for 66 yards and two touchdowns .
of his 11 touchdowns this year , eight have come since the start of week 11 .
he has 548 rushing yards , 28 receptions and 258 receiving yards this season .
running back deuce mcallister could see a few more touches with bush out , yet even when bush was out earlier this year , mcallister only once received more than eight utilizations in a game ; the team used him 22 times in week 8. mcallister has just 317 rushing yards on the season and only 54 since the team 's week 9 bye .
however , he does have three of his four touchdowns in that stretch .
fullback mike karney has received five utilizations in the last two weeks , though most are on short-yardage situations .
fantasy owners carrying bush have almost certainly missed out on thomas ; .
if for some reason he is available , pick him up immediately .
mcallister is a last-ditch flex option as the saints face the detroit lions in week 16 , but playing him is a risk given thomas ' versatility .
karney is not a viable fantasy back .
