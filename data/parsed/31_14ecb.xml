hansbrough broke ford 's all-time scoring record at north carolina during the game .
a captive audience that included an emotional tyler hansbrough watched intently as the smith center video boards mixed in congratulatory remarks with the collection of memorable plays .
the accompanying music : o.a.r. hit " shattered . " .
hansbrough , north carolina 's new career scoring leader , approached midcourt when the song ended. unc legend phil ford bowed before him .
hansbrough passed ford for the top spot in school history while posting 20 points in the top-ranked tar heels ' 91-73 victory against evansville on thursday night .
hansbrough entered the game with 2,282 points , eight fewer than ford 's total from 1974-78 .
he broke the record when he posted up on the right block , spun toward the middle of the lane and banked in an off-balanced shot over james haarsma with 7:42 remaining in the first half .
hansbrough missed a dunk 23 seconds later with unc leading 24-20 , and the tar heels ( 10-0 ) took control with a 19-4 run .
" i 'm usually not nervous before games , and i was a little nervous before tonight just because i felt like there was a lot of pressure , " hansbrough said .
" one thing for me , i did n't want to strictly focus on trying to break a scoring record .
we had a game , and i was trying to do whatever i could to help the team .
" whenever it did happen , i was thrilled and excited it was over .
also , i felt very honored . " .
officials stopped the game when hansbrough , who now has 2,302 points , made the record-setting basket. ford , an assistant coach with the charlotte bobcats , was posing for a courtside picture with two unc students when the ball went through the net .
ford , coach roy williams and director of athletics dick baddour presented hansbrough with the gameball during the brief stoppage in play .
" it 's an honor to be compared in the same breath with tyler , " ford said .
" when i look at how hard he plays and how he listens to coach williams , as a player , that 's what i tried to do .
as a player i would n't outrun a lot of people or outjump a lot of people - i was extremely quick , i will say that .
" the only thing i had going for me is i played for a great coach who brought out the best abilities in the things i could do .
i think that 's what tyler does . " .
the postgame ceremony featured comments from williams , strength and conditioning coach jonas sahratian , brendan haywood , marvin williams , raymond felton , antawn jamison , marcus ginyard and bobby frasor .
it also included clips of hansbrough 's dunk over 7-foot-7 kenny george , his buzzer-beating shot against virginia tech in the 2008 acc tournament and his game-clinching 3-pointer at duke as a freshman .
ford made a favorable impression early in his unc career at an unlikely sight : the fetzer field track .
roy williams recalled the effort ford put forth to complete the team 's mile run in a predetermined amount of time .
" the coaches are counting out the time as phil ford comes in there , and he dove across the line at fetzer on the asphalt track , " williams said .
" tyler hansbrough would have done that .
" that , to me , is one of the most special things .
phil ford is one of the greatest competitors i 've ever seen , and tyler hansbrough is also .
there 's not a lot of people in that classroom . " .
hansbrough , like ford , declined an opportunity to leave school for the nba following his junior season .
the fun of college is one reason hansbrough , who 's on pace to take over the acc career scoring mark currently held by duke alum j.j. redick , returned to unc .
the tar heels are favored to win the national championship , but the pursuit of a title is n't always serious business even if hansbrough 's interaction with teammates such as larry drew suggests otherwise .
" there was a lot of hype around this game , but before the game the whole team is around playing xbox and 'mortal kombat , ' " frasor said .
" he 's getting into it , calling larry a cheater .
stuff like that you would n't get at a professional level . " .
