andrew luck wielded his fourth quarter magic wand yet again , willing colts to victory over hapless chiefs and into the 2012 playoffs !
what a remarkable story .
too bad the game that put the 2012 indianapolis colts into the playoffs was such a dud .
but , a win is a win , and prior to the start of the 2012 regular season , very few ( if any ! ) people had the colts winning ten games and earning a post - season birth .
on sunday , in their week 16 match - up with a kansas city team some thought would be a playoff contender in 2012 , the colts took care of business and dispatched the chiefs 20 - 13 .
the key to the game was ( drrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrums rolling . . . ) turnovers !
kansas city had several .
the colts had zilcho .
two brady quinn interceptions and a boneheaded fumbled by jamaal charles were what won this game for the colts .
that , and some fourth quarter heroics by the offense , but mostly it was kc just being really , really bad .
for the second time this season , darius butler picked off a pass and returned it for a td .
in this game , he did it on kc's opening driving , scooping the ball off the turf and scampering in from 32 yards out to give the colts a 7 - 0 lead .
unfortunately , the colts offense simply could not sustain drives .
dropped passes ( i counted three ) were the bane of indy's offense early on .
because drives could not be sustained , the chiefs began to gash the colts in the running game .
kc blasted indy with 352 net rushing yards .
three hundred and fifty two !
jesus h . christ !
still , to further illustrate to you , our well - informed readers , how running the football is nearly meaningless in this league , the chiefs never led in this game despite running all over an extremely porous and injured colts defense .
part of the reason kc ran so effectively was the awful play of pat angerer , how should so obviously be on ir right now it's not even funny .
he redeemed himself a bit by forcing a critical fumble late in the second quarter , but that play was mostly the fumble - prone jamaal charles ( 3 on the season ) being careless with the ball .
still , despite three turnovers , kc managed to tie the game going itno the fourth .
then , as he has done so many times this year , andrew luck wielded his magic wand and willed the colts to victory .
the colts offense went on a 13 - play drive starting at their own 27 , ate up 6 : 05 of the clock , and capped it off with a 7 - yard touchdown pass from luck to ( who else ) reggie wayne .
ballgame .
20 - 13 .
colts win .
the colts are the second team in nfl history to make the post - season the year after posting a 2 - 14 ( or worse ) record the year prior .
andrew luck set an nfl record , throwing for 205 yards in the game , swelling his season yardage to 4 , 183 .
cam newton in 2011 had the previous record with 4 , 051 yards .
the guy who had it before cam ?
peyton manning in 1998 with 3 , 739 .
luck's fourth quarter drive was his 7th game - winning drive this season .
that's both a rookie record and an nfl record .
no qb has ever had seven game - winning drives in one year .
unbelievable .
dwayne allen also got into the record books .
he eclipsed ken dilger's franchise record for catches by a rookie tight end in one season .
allen had three catches on sunday , bringing his season total to 43 .
dilger had 42 in 1995 .
dilger's quarterback that year ?
jim harbaugh , the man who would go on to recruit andrew luck at stanford before going to to coach the san francisco 49ers .
with the win in kc , coupled with the steelers losing to the bengals 13 - 10 , all the teams in the afc playoffs are set .
also locked up is the no . 5 seed for the colts .
they will face the no . 4 seed , which could mean a trip to baltimore to face the ravens , the team chuck pagano used to coach for .
speaking of pagano , he is scheduled to return to work full - time tomorrow as the head coach after taking a leave of absence to battle leukemia .
his cancer is now in remission , and he returns to a team that is bound for the post - season .
wonderful story .
wonderful season .
couldn't ask for anything more .
well , except one thing . . .
win in the playoffs !
go colts .
