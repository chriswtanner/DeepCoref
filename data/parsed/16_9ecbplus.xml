death for orozco .
posted : 04 / 02 / 07 , 9 : 00 pm pdt | .
a convicted cop killer laughed tuesday after hearing a jury's ruling that he be put to death .
jose luis orozco showed almost no emotion throughout the three - week trial in which he was convicted of the 2005 murder of los angeles county sheriff's deputy jerry ortiz .
a rare exception for the 29 - year - old hawaiian gardens gang member was an occasional smile for his mother when he turned in his chair to glance back at her from time to time .
he will be sentenced may 3 .
when the jury convicted him last month of the deputy's slaying , as well as the attempted murder of another man just a few days prior to the ambush killing of ortiz , orozco sat staring straight ahead , unflinching .
as court clerk dan fallon read the jury's sentence shortly before noon tuesday , several members of the slain lawman's family gasped , clutching one another's hands .
at the same time , a small smile spread across orozco's face and he chuckled .
"we understand and we appreciate the gravity of the decision that the jury had to make . . . , and that it took a lot for them to ( come to that decision ) , " chela ortiz , the deputy's wife , said afterward .
"we appreciate everything they did , we know they were very careful . . . and gave this a lot of their attention . " .
chela ortiz - who was married three weeks before her husband was murdered - sat with her mother in - law , rosa ortiz , and the rest of the family every day of the trial .
they were accompanied by dozens of sheriff's deputies and other family friends , including the family's priest .
most days were difficult and filled with tears as they listened to chilling testimony recounting the last few minutes of ortiz's life and saw , for the first time , the crime scene and autopsy photos .
"i think , for all of us , it was kind of reliving the nightmare all over , " chela ortiz said .
family members listened to testimony that included the defendant's violent past and the many times he escaped prosecution by using his gang's influence and power to intimidate victims - including two nearly killed when they were shot and stabbed in the back by orozco , according to prosecutors .
orozco's friends and fellow gang members also recalled his boasting about killing a cop one day .
"i just say thank god it is over , " the deputy's mother , rosa ortiz , said .
"it was too much some days . . .
to me it was too hard . " .
it took the jury of six men and six women a little more than four hours , spread over two days , to choose death over life in prison without the possibility of parole .
it was almost the same amount of time used to come to the guilty verdict on march 20 .
according to three jurors who spoke briefly outside the courtroom , the decision was a difficult one made slightly easier by the thorough job of the prosecutors and investigators .
none of them wanted to be identified because of the gang ties to the case .
the physical evidence , which including orozco's dna and fingerprints found on the murder weapon , was overwhelming , they said .
there were also a number of eye witnesses including two girls who described for the jury how orozco hid behind their front door and shot the deputy as ortiz spoke with their mother .
equally as damning , jurors said , was the complete lack of remorse shown by the defendant .
he squandered two opportunities to turn his life around , including chances to relocate out of state and away from the gang with his family in las vegas and again with a friend and former gang member in florida , they said .
it looked to them as though he preferred the life of a criminal and reveled in the notoriety he earned in the deputy's death .
a taped conversation between orozco and two friends - one a fellow gang member and the other an associate - in a holding cell at the bellflower courthouse made it clear to the jury that a life in prison would not diminish his threat to society , they said .
in that tape , orozco is heard talking about destroying evidence and ordering a hit on the two little girls and their mother - the star witnesses in the case .
"i had to hear that tape again , " one juror said .
"because if we were going to send him to jail for life , he could run the same business from behind bars , " a second juror added .
"this way he can't harm anyone anymore . " .
apartment murder .
ortiz was assigned to track orozco down the day before his june 24 , 2005 murder .
that task stemmed from the june 20 , 2005 shooting of a black man who - according to prosecutors - orozco tried to kill simply because of his race .
the 15 - year veteran , who learned the day before that he had made the rank of detective , was patrolling in hawaiian gardens near 223rd street when he spotted orozco and tried to stop him .
the gang member took off running with ortiz behind him , according to court testimony .
ortiz followed orozco to an apartment complex in the 12500 block of east 223rd street , to the home of one of orozco's friends whom the deputy knew from previous altercations , at about 3 : 30 p . m .
what ortiz didn't know was that orozco was lurking behind the woman's front door .
as ortiz spoke to her and reholstered his weapon , orozco steadied his hand while two of the woman's children - girls age 6 and 8 - and several of her friends looked on .
he fired just one shot from his . 38 - caliber revolver , with the slug passing through a crack in the door and hitting the deputy in the side of the head .
the 35 - year - old newlywed and father to two boys died almost immediately .
tactical decision .
stan perlo , one of two court - appointed defense attorneys assigned to orozco , said the defendant's lack of support from his family dealt a massive blow to their case .
originally , orozco's mother was to take the stand to tell her son's story and talk about the many problems he faced growing up , perlo said .
but she became nervous , telling her son the night before she was to testify that she did not want to go through with it , perlo explained .
orozco agreed not to force his mother to have to take the witness stand , a decision that likely destroyed his chance at any mercy on the part of the jury , he said .
"our problem was we had no one to tell his story , " perlo said .
"we were counting on his mom and . . . she was too nervous to testify . " .
perlo and co - counsel robin yanes approached orozco's case from a somewhat unorthodox position .
rather than argue their client's innocence , they repeatedly referred to their client as the gunman in the presence of the jury and focused on a number of other people they claimed were equally responsible in the crime .
it was a tactical decision reached by the two veteran attorneys , both with extensive experience with death penalty cases , and after consultation with their peers , perlo explained .
"we made a lot of decisions that some lawyers would disagree with , " he said .
"i would add , personally , a lot of lawyers with a lot less experience . " .
long process .
when orozco returns to court on may 3 , perlo and yanes will argue for a mistrial and , if that is rejected , will ask judge philip hickok to modify the jury's verdict and consider life without parole .
the chance either argument will be successful is slight , perlo said .
but that then sets into motion the automatic appeals process , something that will be handled by a different set of attorneys .
during that time , orozco will not be housed with the general population , he will have a cell all his own giving him isolation from much of the gang violence in the state's prisons .
at the very least , perlo estimated the appeals process will last five years .
it could run into 20 years because there are both state and federal requirements that must be met , he added .
a large part of the problem stems from finding lawyers who are available for such a lengthy commitment of time , who are willing to take on a stressful job and who are qualified , perlo said .
"the decision today made the family happy , but unfortunately it's a false happiness , " perlo said after court tuesday .
"i've dealt with issues of death for many years . . .
the death penalty rarely offers . . . closure . " .
the ortiz family , however , disagreed .
"i'm kind of relieved that it's over , " said 17 - year - old jeremy ortiz , one of the deputy's sons from a previous marriage .
"i'm happy with the verdict , we just have to wait it out now . " .
prior to the reading of the verdict , the deputy's family and friends waited in a courtroom filled to capacity but so quiet one could could hear the slight squeaks of the attorneys' leather chairs .
some bowed their heads and rubbed their faces , while others clasped their hands as though in prayer .
when the sentence was finally announced a collective gasp for air was followed by cries and sobs as relatives sitting behind the family leaned forward to rub their shoulders and give a comforting squeeze .
outside the courtroom , rosa ortiz took out a button with a laminated picture of her slain son in uniform and handed it to the eldest of her five children , art ortiz , so that he could pin it on her blouse .
once it was secure she kissed it tenderly .
for many minutes afterward , relatives and friends stood outside the courtroom hugging and crying .
detective dawn retzlaff , one of the two lead homicide detectives on the case , said authorities were grateful for the jury's thorough and careful review of the facts and investigators were happy with the verdict , calling it just .
speaking on behalf of the sheriff's department , retzlaff added that they wanted to express their condolences to ortiz's family in what was a devastating time .
"it's not a happy day for anybody , " said deputy district attorney lowell anger , who prosecuted the case along with fellow da phillip stirling .
anger said that the message sent by the jury's sentence - that killing a police officer and flaunting all respect for authority and for life will not be tolerated - was clear .
it was the constant support from anger , stirling and the district attorney's office , from the sheriff's department and other law enforcement agencies , and from the family's large circle of friends that made the tumultuous trial more bearable , chela and her in - laws insisted .
"we could never repay them for all the support and love they have for this family , and that they have for jerry , " chela said .
