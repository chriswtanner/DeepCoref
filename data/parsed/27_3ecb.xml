critical ie patch now available : go get it !
in thursday 's it blogwatch , richi jennings watches bloggers watch microsoft 's latest out-of-cycle , critical patch for internet explorer .
not to mention portability , 1980 's style ... .
as it promised [ tuesday ] , microsoft corp. today issued an emergency patch to plug a critical hole in internet explorer ( ie ) that attackers have been increasingly exploiting from hacked web sites .
the patch , described in microsoft 's security bulletin ms08-078 , fixes a flaw in the data-binding function of all available versions of the popular browser , including ie5.01 , ie6 , ie7 and ie8 beta 2 .
microsoft labeled the bug as " critical , " the most serious threat ranking in its four-step scoring system .
according to both microsoft and numerous security firms , attacks have been mounting , particularly since last weekend , when hackers began hijacking legitimate web sites and launching exploits against unwary visitors .
in fact , microsoft said it monitored a " huge increase " in attacks last saturday .
the number of infected web sites , many of them legitimate , has grown at " an alarming " rate since the vulnerability was released into the wild and people need to do nothing but visit an infected site with a vulnerable browser to be affected .
by friday , microsoft was aware users were becoming infected at a rate even faster than previous zero-day exploits .
originally porn sites seemed to be the carriers , but the number of legit sites causing infections was skyrocketing .
hackers were planting the exploit using well-known sql injection techniques .
it is users ' turn to protect themselves by installing this emergency patch and all all the others , and fast .
since the bad guys were exploiting it before microsoft knew it existed , the exploit is termed " zero day " because that is how much notice microsoft got of the problem .
it is also termed an " drive-by " exploit since a user could pick up a malware infestation by merely using ie to browse any of thousands of compromised websites .
in short , it was really nasty stuff .
brian krebs sounds worried .
microsoft estimated monday that one in every 500 windows users had been exposed to sites that try to exploit the flaw .
additionally , it said the number of victims was increasing at a rate of 50 percent daily .
this is an urgent update .
if you use windows , apply this patch now .
microsoft 's mike reavey grabs the mic .
this update will be applied automatically to hundreds of millions of customers through automatic updates over the next few days .
and , for our enterprise customers - with multiple systems within their networks - this update can be deployed through all standard security update management systems including , sccm , sms , wsus , and windows update .
this update meets the quality , deployment and application compatibility criteria .
it is a high-quality update , ready for broad release , and we encourage customers to test and deploy this update as quickly as possible .
we were able to share detailed information with our partners in the microsoft active protections program ( mapp ) and microsoft security response alliance ( msra ) , allowing protections to be created for over 24 different security partners ' products .
this is further validation of our commitment to 'community based defense ' and means customers that ... were n't even using microsoft products , were also protected from known attacks .
ed oswald is impressed by microsoft 's speed .
well , that was quick .
it 's pretty bad when security experts are telling your customers to switch .
these are unbiased ( for the most part ) folks , and the typical computer user is going to take their advice seriously .
but tiny dancer ... well , not so much .
eight days is rather shamefully long to have to wait for a potentially devastating vulnerability to be fixed .
this ai n't hanukkah , microsoft , and you ai n't no maccabee .
