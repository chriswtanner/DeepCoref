"she's not a loose cannon .
she's a hard worker , works very hard .
she's very spiritual . " .
kenneth dorsey says the woman accused of killing two co - workers and critically injuring a third at the kraft plant in northeast philly is a good person .
and so were the two women she's accused of gunning down with a . 357 magnum , just minutes after she'd been suspended and escorted from the building .
dorsey's been at the plant for 37 years and worked on the third floor with the three victims and the alleged shooter , yvonne hiller .
"they had argued , from what i was told , they argued , " dorsey told nbc10's rosemary connors after the shootings thursday night .
"i had just started my job , you know and i heard like bang , bang , but you hear noises everyday at a bakery so you don't pay any mind . " .
then a co - worker yelled , "come on , you got to leave now !
she's shooting . " .
after the shootings , hiller holed up in an office on the second floor where the swat team found her after co - workers who were hiding in the office next door tipped off building security .
"i never thought in my deepest heart that it would come down to this , " dorsey said .
some co - workers said she had a history of run - ins with other workers and management , dorsey said like anyone , they sometimes had their differences , but always got along .
"we talked about her muslim faith and i wished her happy ramadan , " dorsey said .
"i might be wrong , but my guess is she had some people that she had issues with and a personal agenda , a score she had to settle . " .
dorsey said the shooting was going to be hard on everyone .
"we're like family here . " .
"tell your audience to keep the families in your prayers , however you pray - - whether you're jewish , christian , muslim - - we're all in shock . . .
and i lost two of my closest friends . . .
i'm gonna go home and take a shower and read the bible and pray .
hopefully , i can get through this .
