on april 24th , 2013 .
we can expect more carriers to be coming out talking about the q10 but t - mobile is the first in the us .
they just confirmed that they will carry the device though they said nothing about availability and pricing .
they did say that after april 29th business customers will be able to register for the q10 at this link .
