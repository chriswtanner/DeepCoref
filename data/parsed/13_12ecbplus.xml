farewell to another piece of mat maid .
fast - moving fire destroyed the historic matanuska maid warehouse early this morning .
the building was long vacant .
no injuries were reported .
firefighters arriving on scene could see the building was likely a total loss , so they focused on a bigger problem : making sure the blaze didn't reach the nearby , petroleum - loaded crowley maritime tank farm .
the first 9 - 1 - 1 call came at 3 : 33 a . m . from someone at valley hotel , palmer public safety director jon owen said this morning .
a total of 31 separate pieces of firefighting apparatus responded to the blaze , including three ladder trucks .
engines came from palmer fire department and mat - su central fire department , where responders mustered to an "all - call" from emergency dispatchers .
palmer fire chief john mcnutt was the first person to get to the fire .
mcnutt drove around the 9 - acre mat maid complex and spotted flames shooting out from below the eaves .
within minutes , the roof was engulfed , owen said .
crews operating under a "surround and drown" strategy suppressed the fire .
but their goal wasn't saving the old warehouse building , built in the 1930s , owen said .
their focus instead was preventing "the conflagration" sure to follow if the fire reached the adjacent crowley maritime corp . fuel sales office next door , where all the petroleum products on site would pose a tremendous problem should they ignite , he said .
the palmer tank farm holds 100 , 000 gallons of petroleum products and serves as a distribution center for anchorage , palmer , wasilla , and all the matanuska valley , according to crowley's web site .
the fire was knocked down by 6 : 40 a . m .
the warehouse used to be used for produce sold out of one end .
rindi remembers walking through it with owner bill ingaldson a few years back ; during the visit , she picked up an old potato sack decorated with the matanuska maid in her skating costume .
palmerites may remember that former city manager bill allen hoped to put a convention center on the property .
this is the second destructive fire at the mat maid complex .
a wind - whipped arson fire set by three teenagers destroyed the hardware store in february , 2003 .
investigators were at the scene by 10 a . m . or so trying to determine the cause of the fire ; finding the ignition source is key when there's no obvious heat source like a boiler , owen said .
anything suspicious will be followed up .
the investigation is being conducted by john bond , an inspector with the alaska state fire marshal's office , and palmer police sgt . shayne la croix .
anyone with information about this morning's fire is asked to call sgt . la croix at 745 - 4811 .
