on nov 10 , 2011 .
the sudan armed forces , or saf , attacked a refugee camp in south sudan at 2 : 53 p . m . local time today .
enough project sources indicated that no one was killed or injured in the attack , contrary to initial estimates from the unity state government .
however , casualty figures remain unconfirmed .
a saf spokesman denied the attack occurred .
at least four bombs were reportedly dropped .
sources on the ground told enough that one bomb , which did not explode , fell directly within the camp , in a primary school yard , with several more falling in the close vicinity .
a reuters correspondent reported hearing a large explosion , then saw "a crater about two metres ( 6 . 6 feet ) wide , an unexploded bomb wedged in the side of a school building and a white aircraft flying north .
observers believe the attacks were carried out by the saf's signature antonov bombers .
one of the bombs landed inside a primary school yard in the camp , according to citizen journalist ryan boyette , who was on the phone with sources in the camp when the raid began .
boyette reported school was in session but no children or staff were injured , since the bomb did not explode .
three other bombs allegedly exploded outside the camp : two landed and exploded on the outskirts , near the airfield where two u . n . aircraft had landed today to deliver food .
the first aircraft departed without incident , but the bombings reportedly began shortly after the second aircraft arrived .
the plane was not damaged .
yida is home to more than 22 , 000 refugees , many of whom walked at least seven days across the border to flee indiscriminate bombing and approaching famine conditions in sudan's south kordofan state .
since fighting between the saf and the sudanese peoples' liberation army - north , or spla - n , began in july , hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled south kordofan , many into the border areas of newly independent south sudan .
the attack on yida camp comes shortly after reports of aerial bombardments in south sudan's upper nile state , making it sudan's second unprovoked military attack on the sovereign state of south sudan in the last three days .
in a november 9 press conference , south sudan president salva kiir stated his country would not retaliate for the reported bombing of guffa in upper nile state on tuesday , which he said killed seven .
it remains to be seen how the government of south sudan will respond to this second attack within its borders ; president kiir held a press conference today on relations with sudan just hours before the alleged attack on yida camp .
"the regime in khartoum is attempting to provoke south sudan into restarting a war , " said enough project co - founder john prendergast , quoted by the associated press .
"the regime's endgame is to either capture south sudan's oilfields along their common border , or achieve a stronger negotiating position on shared oil revenues and border demarcation . this provocation must be countered by the full force of the international community , or else a massive war could unfold .
