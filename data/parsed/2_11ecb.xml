even as oscar organizers on friday unveiled hugh jackman as the host of their gala film awards , the prospect of a u.s. actors strike was casting a long shadow over whether hollywood 's big show would go on as usual .
the academy awards ' february 22 date puts it directly in the path of a potential walkout by screen actors guild members who vote next month on whether to give union leaders permission to call a strike in stalemated contract talks with major studios .
movie making by the big studios has wound down since late june in anticipation of labor strife , compounding a general slowdown from the u.s. recession .
the tension has only been heightened by fatigue from a tumultuous 14-week hollywood writers strike that ended in february and cost the los angeles area economy around $ 3 billion as production stopped on most prime-time tv shows .
" a strike , if one occurred , would be nothing short of horrible , " said ron howard , the former actor and oscar-winning director of " a beautiful mind " whose latest film , " frost/nixon , " is considered a strong oscar contender .
" the timing could n't be worse , " he said on thursday .
actor leonardo dicaprio , who on thursday earned a golden globe nomination for his work in " revolutionary road , " said strike concerns are hitting " everyone . " .
" it 's really important that we come up with a solution , " he said .
" these are unheard-of times , and no one can predict what is going to happen " with the u.s. economy .
sag 's dark cloud .
the oscars , given out by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , are annually hollywood 's glitziest night .
putting the show in jeopardy , however , was this week 's announcement by sag that strike authorization ballots will be mailed to its 120,000 members on january 2 and tallied on january 23 , a full month before the oscars .
that sequence of events raises the prospect of a-list stars boycotting the honors to avoid crossing their own union 's picket lines -- or even carrying picket signs themselves .
the same dynamic came into play last january when a work stoppage by 10,500 writers guild of america members threw the awards season into disarray and caused the star-filled golden globe awards to be replaced by a news conference .
only 5.8 million tv viewers tuned-in , far below the globes ' typical 20 million audience .
broadcaster nbc lost an estimated $ 10 million to $ 15 million in advertising revenue .
the writers strike was settled a month later , sparing the academy awards and its network , abc , a similar fate .
but this time around , the oscars are on the firing line and australian actor jackman , star of the " x-men " movies as well as broadway stage shows , may himself have to pull out .
" at this point , we are moving forward with all of our plans to do our show , and of course we are monitoring what is going on , " said academy spokeswoman leslie unger .
sag leaders say they need a credible strike threat to wrest a better contract deal from the studios than the " final " offer management presented before talks collapsed on june 30 .
they stress , however , that a " yes " vote does not automatically put a strike into effect , and it remains uncertain whether sag can muster the support it needs -- 75 percent of those voting -- to pass its authorization .
talks collapsed over issues that included how much actors would get paid for work on the internet , and the financial impact of a possible strike on hollywood remains unclear .
most films slated for release in 2009 already have been shot , meaning the 2010 slate would see the brunt of a strike .
some tv prime-time dramas and sitcoms will have completed production before sag a work stoppage , though a walkout could hinder development of new series for fall 2009 .
