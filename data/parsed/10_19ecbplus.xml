prediction : red sox will nab teixeira .
espn is reporting that the nationals have offered mark teixeira an 8 - year , $160 million contract .
at the same time , si . com is reporting that , " the red sox are one of the most aggressive pursuers of teixeira , with several executives predicting he may wind up there . " .
the nationals " offer sets the bar for teixeira " s services .
will the sox have to offer more money and / or years , or does playing in boston , for a winning team , with very a passionate fan base mean more than playing near his hometown in maryland ?
naturally scott boras will try to draw this out as long as he can .
however , teixeira has said he would like a resolution by christmas .
the question is , now that the angels have lost out on cc sabathia , will they be all the more motivated to retain teixeira ?
could they swoop in with an overwhelming offer ?
the la times says the angels are reluctant to go past seven years for teixeira .
and though they still need more pitching , the yankees can never be discounted .
however , unfortunately for the angels , ken rosenthal of fox sports reports that two major - league sources said teixeira would prefer to be on the east coast for family reasons .
with that in mind , the nationals and orioles are pushing hard to bring teixeira back to the maryland area .
last night , rosenthal reported that , according to a major - league source , the red sox are making progress in their quest to sign teixeira .
" headway was being made earlier today , " the source said .
and a rival general manager whose plans could be affected by the red sox " s addition of teixeira also indicated that a deal was getting closer .
teixeira is seeking a 10 - year contract for at least $20 million per season .
the red sox preference would be to sign him to a deal between six and eight years .
the free - agent first baseman will be 29 on april 11 , coinciding with the opening week of the 2009 season .
by all indications , he " s a solid long - term investment .
eight years seems like a reasonable contract - length for a player of teixeira " s age and ability .
but if the sox are pushed to 10 years , they would likely deem it acceptable .
they will do whatever it takes to get it done .
teixeira is the big fish they " re determined not to let slip away .
having never hit fewer than 26 homers in his six major - league seasons , teixeira certainly seems like a better long - term investment than sabathia .
paying astronomical money to a guy who plays every day makes more sense than guaranteeing it to one who plays every five days , and who has weight issues .
questions about his long term durability will continue to dog sabathia for at least the next couple of years .
teixeira remains the hottest commodity on the free agent market because he " s been durable , injury - free , and highly productive .
over six full seasons , his career stat line looks like this : . 290 average , . 919 ops , 203 hr , 676 rbi .
last season , split between the braves and angels , teixeira hit . 308 , with 33 home runs and 121 rbi .
he " s proven himself in both leagues .
he is an all star , a two - time gold glove winner , and a two - time silver slugger winner .
without question , teixeira is a very solid hitter and a bona fide slugger ; he is one of just five players in major league history to hit at least 100 home runs in his first three seasons .
for these reasons , he has been described as the " apple of theo epstein " s eye . " .
this is why the red sox will not fail in their effort to bring home their single highest priority this offseason .
