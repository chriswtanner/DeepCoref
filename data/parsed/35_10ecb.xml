chargers ' jackson arrested on suspicion of dui .
but after being arrested for suspicion dui earlier this week , he has bigger worries than his role in the chargers ' offense .
10news in san diego is reporting that jackson was arrested by the california highway patrol early tuesday morning after failing sobriety tests .
chp officer brad baehr said jackson was on probation for a previous dui arrest .
the chargers will not discipline jackson at this time , but it 's almost a guarantee that the nfl will step in and suspend him for several games at the start of this season .
however , unless you hear otherwise , jackson will be playing in this week 's divisional playoff at pittsburgh .
those in postseason leagues ( like our salcap game or our 3-for-all game ) should avoid jackson , but not just because of his recent troubles with the law .
he was held without a catch for the second time all year last week , and this week he faces pittsburgh 's top-ranked pass defense ( 156.9 yards allowed per game ) .
in san diego 's first meeting with the steelers this season , jackson was held to just two catches for 25 yards .
jackson 's recent run-in with the law effectively puts an end to his keeper value for next season .
