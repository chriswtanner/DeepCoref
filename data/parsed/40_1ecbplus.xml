apple is certainly making wwdc a hardware conference this year - - it just unveiled a refresh of the existing macbook pro running intel's newer ivy bridge processors on the san francisco gathering's opening day .
the 13 - and 15 - inch portables run up to 2 . 7ghz quad core i7s ( turbo up to 3 . 7ghz ) , carry up to 8gb of ram and have geforce gt 650m - based graphics 60 percent faster than the previous generation .
like the new macbook air , they tout usb 3 . 0 ports .
if you're more comfortable with apple's conventional macbook pro design than the new variety , apple will ask $1 , 099 for the base 13 - inch version and $1 , 799 for a 15 - inch version , with an upgraded 15 - inch model going for $2 , 199 .
all of them are shipping today - - we're not seeing any mention of an updated 17 - inch version , so it may have been cast aside .
