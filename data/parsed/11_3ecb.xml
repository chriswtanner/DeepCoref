voters in turkmenistan cast ballots sunday in a parliamentary election hailed by the government as an exercise in democracy but dismissed by critics as a sham .
the election of a 125-seat national legislature is the first parliamentary vote in the natural-gas rich central asian nation since the death of longtime autocrat saparmurat niyazov two years ago .
his successor , gurbanguli berdymukhamedov , says the election is a key step in the development of democracy .
but while the seats are contested , only one political party is legally registered in turkmenistan , and its opponents have no foothold in politics .
the u.s. and europe are courting turkmenistan as they seek to diversify energy sources and were watching the vote for signs of change .
