microsoft releases emergency patch for web browser .
microsoft was to release an emergency patch yesterday to fix a perilous software flaw allowing hackers to hijack internet explorer ( ie ) browsers and take over computers .
the us software giant said on tuesday that in response to " the threat to customers " it immediately mobilized security engineering teams worldwide to deliver a software cure " in the unprecedented time of eight days . " .
researchers at software security firm trend micro say attacks based on the vulnerability in the world 's most popular web browser are " spreading like wildfire " with millions of computers already compromised .
microsoft typically releases patches for its software on the second on tuesday of each month and rushing this fix to computer users out-of-cycle is testimony to the severe danger of the threat , according to trend micro .
" when the patch is released people should run , not walk , to get it installed , " said trend micro advanced threat researcher paul ferguson .
" this vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber-criminals and getting worse every day , " he said .
trend micro has identified about 10,000 web sites that have been infected with malicious software that can be surreptitiously slipped into visitors ' unprotected ie browsers to take advantage of the flaw .
" what makes this so insidious it takes advantage of a big gaping hole of ie , which has the largest install base of any browser on the market , " ferguson said .
ie is used on nearly three-quarters of the world 's computers , industry statistics from last month showed .
microsoft 's move came one day after cisco issued a report saying armies of hijacked computers are flooding the world with spam as hackers devise slicker ways to take over unwitting people 's machines .
virus-infected computers are woven into " botnets " used to attack more machines and to send specious sales pitches to e-mail addresses in low-cost quests to bilk readers out of cash .
" every year we see threats evolve as criminals discover new ways to exploit people , networks and the internet , " cisco chief security researcher patrick peterson said .
this year , botnets were used to inject an array of legitimate web sites with an iframes malicious code that reroutes visitors to web sites that download computer viruses into their machines , cisco said .
