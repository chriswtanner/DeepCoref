mark felt , the most famous anonymous source in the history of journalism who was known to the world as " deep throat " , died yesterday aged 95 .
as the associate director of the fbi , mr felt was outraged by the nixon administration 's attempts to block its investigation of the watergate scandal which ultimately led to the resignation of president richard nixon in 1974 .
a master of counter-intelligence from his days tracking german wwii spies , he secretly helped washington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein pursue the story .
it was thirty four years before he finally broke cover , admitting in 2006 .
" i 'm the guy they used to call deep throat . " .
by then , he was so crippled by a stroke and alzheimer 's disease that his memory of his role in us history had almost vanished .
from the first day of the bungled 1972 break-in of the democratic national committee 's headquarters in the watergate hotel mr felt was at the heart of the fbi investigation .
the agency soon learned that the nixon administration was running an extensive spying and sabotage campaign against its political enemies .
under intense pressure from the white house to suppress its investigation , the fbi was starting to buckle .
a protagonist of the famous fbi director herbert hoover , the mr felt was already embittered for being passed over as his replacement .
when white house officials tried to block the fbi 's corruption investigation , he became infuriated with what he would call their 'switchblade mentality . ' .
a debonair man about town and incurable political gossip , mr felt was already known to mr woodward when he first reached out to him .
soon he was arranging cloak and dagger meetings with the young reporters in darkened parking garages across the potomac river .
the chain-smoking fbi-man provided an insight into the scale of the presidential scandal that was larger than anyone had imagined .
" deep throat " , the name given to him at the washington post , was a wordplay based on a well known pornographic movie and his insistence on remaining on " deep background " despite the sensational nature of his revelations .
from the outset president nixon suspected him of being the leaker and five times ordered the fbi director patrick gray to fire him .
felt 's adamant denials were convincing enough and he was never sacked .
deep throat continued to leak and on the assumption that he was being monitored he had elaborate procedures for contacting mr woodward .
when he had information to pass on , he would arrange meetings by circling the page number on page twenty of the reporter 's copy of the new york times and then drawing the hands of a clock to signal the hour .
if mr woodward wanted to see him he would simply place a red flag in a flowerpot on the balcony of his p street apartment .
over the course of the scandal , deep throat supplied crucial information for some 400 washington post stories .
the reporters went on to win a pulitzer prize , journalism 's highest accolade .
a master of the black arts of disinformation , at fbi headquarters he alighted on a newspaper story for which he was not the source and ordered an investigation to find the leaker .
he then fingered a prosecutor as the source .
mr woodward wrote in his 2006 expose , " secret man : the story of watergate 's deep throat " that " the memo was an effective cover for him , the very best counterintelligence tradecraft .
not only had he initiated the leak inquiry , but felt appeared to have discovered the leaker . " .
by then deep throat 's real identity had already been revealed in vanity fair magazine .
more than 30 years after watergate and mr woodward confirmed the revelation , finally letting his secret out .
by then mr felt was suffering from dementia and had little or no memory of his role in history .
though deep throat was a hero to the anti vietnam war movement and the left , mr felt was no liberal .
a law and order crime-fighter , he ran the agency 's " goon squad " to monitor agents in the field .
he also advised hollywood for its 1965 television series the fbi , ensuring that g-men were always shown in the most favourable light .
long after watergate he was convicted of running his own so called " black bag " burglaries of the radical weather underground movement .
he was later pardoned by president ronald reagan .
in a 1979 book , he bragged about the fbi 's bugging of the civil rights leader martin luther king and he vehemently opposed the hiring of women agents by the fbi .
