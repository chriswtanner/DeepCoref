officers found a 12 - gauge pump - action shotgun and three live shells in the vehicle , but lacalamita as " subdued .

'pop , pop , pop' .
" we heard pop , pop , pop , " smelled gunpowder and heard co - workers yelling , said jean larson , 48 , a staff accountant for g&c , a subsidiary of gordon advisors .
" i heard one employee screaming , ‘ he " s got a gun .
he " s got a gun . " . . .
it was a panic .
no one knew what to do .
no one knew where to go . " .
after briefly assembling in the employee lunchroom , some employees opted to hole up inside individual offices .
larson joined two female co - workers , barricading the locked door with chairs , turning off the lights and silencing their cell phones .
beneath a desk , the three curled up and kept quiet .
" i was just so scared , " larson said .
" i just kept thinking , ‘ this can " t be happening . " " .
police said the person killed was a 63 - year - old woman from warren but would not name her .
a message posted monday afternoon on the accounting firm " s web site said the office would be closed tuesday in memory of madeline kafoury .

larson said kafoury was well - known and well - liked .
she said kafoury retired last year following the conclusion of tax season , but returned part - time this year after her successor quit .
troy police lt . gerry scherlinck identified the other victims as a 47 - year - old man and a 48 - year - old man .
wolfe said the families of the wounded men requested privacy , and the hospital would not release any details about their conditions .
" i " m not positive all three of the people were targeted but there appeared to be some purpose , " troy police chief charles craft said .
lacalamita was being held on charges of fleeing and eluding police and was expected to be charged tuesday in the shooting .
lacalamita was fired last week , craft said , but still was listed on the web site of gordon advisors .
