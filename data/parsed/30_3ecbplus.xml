an undersea telecommunications cable cut on tuesday partially blocked internet and mobile services in alexandria and some other governorates .
the cable cut happened around the same time that a different cable , owned by telecom egypt , was cut that also affected services , egyptian authorities said .
mahmoud al - goweiny , a member of the national telecommunications regulatory authority's board of directors , told al - masry al - youm that this particular undersea cable has frequently malfunctioned since late 2007 .
ahmed osama , deputy executive director of telecom egypt , said the cable passes through egypt from europe and reaches asia .
osama said the cut's effect in egypt was limited , and there haven't been clear reports about a cause .
"some internet users suffered problems with internet and mobile services , osama noted .
osama attributed these problems to the telecom egypt cable cut , which affected etisalat egypt and linkdotnet , two of egypt's largest internet services providers .
no further details were reported about the effects of the cuts .
