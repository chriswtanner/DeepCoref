peter capaldi is the bookies' favourite to become the next doctor who .
there has been a surge in bets on capaldi , who plays sweary spin doctor malcom tucker in the thick of it , replacing matt smith , according to william hill .
joe crilly , a spokesperson for william hill , said : 'peter capaldi was not even in our list a few days ago but he has been the subject of a lot of betting interest recently and this gamble would suggest that if he does not have the part already , he is almost certainly on the shortlist . ' .
he now has odds of 2 / 1 to become the 12th time lord above ben daniels and rory kinnear .
previous favourite kinnear has slipped down the list after he ruled himself out of the running , claiming he's never seen an episode of doctor who .
capaldi's name may have been linked to the role after doctor who creator steven moffat said he would not rule out casting an older doctor .
he said at the recent san diego comic - con : 'we've never not considered an older doctor .
it is completely on all the lists we make - there are absolutely older doctors . ' .
