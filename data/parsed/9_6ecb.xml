when planning to widen interstate 90 through snoqualmie pass , state transportation brass , federal agencies and greens wisely opted to cut down on road ( and people ) kill , and to give peace a chance .
the result will be a series of wildlife overpasses and underpasses , and efforts to make gold creek a healthy home to the endangered bull trout .
the unspoken trade-off : no lawsuits will hold up or raise costs on work that benefits the economy , and eases the drive to and from eastern washington .
before leaving the political stage , the bush administration aims to kiss off this kind of modest use of intelligence .
it is , said rep. jay inslee , d-wash. , the bushies ' " last sour note . " .
using the christmas season for cover , the interior department on thursday issued " revised " regulations designed to shield federal projects from review under the endangered species act .
" i 've been waiting and holding my breath for one last awful thing ( bush ) would do to be remembered by , and he has done it , " said rep. jim mcdermott , d-wash .
the administration ignored comments from 300,000 citizens and adopted a policy that would allow federal agencies to ignore one of the nation 's basic environmental laws .
it would eliminate some requirements for independent review by scientists -- notably from the u.s. fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service -- as agencies plan projects involving timber sales , road construction and oil leases .
new rules would also prohibit federal agencies from assessing how a proposed project would add to global warming or jeopardize species habitat .
" nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed , " interior secretary dirk kempthorne told reporters .
huh ?
" if this rule had been implemented in years past , highway builders could have done what they wanted , without talking to the fish and wildlife service .
we would probably not be seeing the improvements on i-90 , " said rick mcguire of the alpine lakes protection society .
" the i-90 corridor has been a berlin wall between the northern cascades and southern cascades .
if you do n't make the means to cross a road like this , it 's bad for wildlife .
and it 's bad for people who hit wildlife . " .
inslee noted the administration 's recent two-step maneuver in the chukchi sea off the north coast of alaska .
the fish and wildlife service formally listed the polar bear under the endangered species act , due to the threat from global warming .
ignoring the listing , the feds ' minerals management service proceeded to sell oil leases where the bears live .
the bush administration finalized a retroactive justification on thursday .
it created a " special rule " for polar bears , allowing oil and gas drilling , as long as oil companies obey the marine mammal protection act .
" polar bears do n't need a listing .
they need ice , " said inslee .
inslee noted the role of the late sen. henry jackson , d-wash. , who backed oil development in the arctic and helped write the endangered species act .
" senator jackson and others had the foresight and intelligence to say : let us allow the expertise of government scientists to be tapped before decisions are made , " inslee added .
" that 's what the consultation process does .
it has been used to good effect in our state . " .
critics of the endangered species act often substitute anecdote for fact .
they 've argued that consultation with government scientists means holdups and more work .
in a filing with the interior department , however , the natural resources defense council noted that no evidence of delay and cost was produced to support relaxing the law .
quite the contrary .
the new policy nixes informal consultation between agencies intended to determine whether a project needs more formal and detailed environmental review .
the likely result will be " erroneous findings " by agencies , argued the nrdc .
what 's the consequence ?
project opponents will get grounds to sue .
" we will look at the final ( rule ) language when it is published tomorrow , but i think we will see them in court , " said andrew welzler of the nrdc .
putting teeth back in the endangered species act , and reversing the new rule , presents a tricky , time-consuming task for the obama administration .
the makeup of obama 's environmental team has surfaced in recent days .
it is urban , and largely eastern .
the incoming environmental protection agency boss , lisa jackson , has worked as new jersey 's environmental commissioner .
soon-to-be senior white house aide carol browner , an al gore protagonist , is from florida .
obama brass would be well advised to turn for help to the pacific northwest and mountain west .
our government leaders have dealt with tricky issues involving endangered species act listings of puget sound salmon runs and orcas .
east coast environmentalists , in high government posts , proved tone-deaf and clumsy when dealing with endangered species issues in the clinton and carter administrations .
what 's needed now is political savvy , plus what george w. bush , in his 2000 campaign , described as " sound science . " .
