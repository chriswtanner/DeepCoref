in another successful anti-piracy operation , navy warship on saturday repulsed an attack on a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden and nabbed 23 somali and yemeni sea brigands , in a show of resolve to weed out the menace that affected maritime trade in the region .
the pirates on two speed boats had surrounded the merchant vessel flying the ethiopian flag around noon , when ins mysore warship intervened and warded off the attack , navy spokesperson said .
the pirates had fired at the merchant vessel with their small arms , when it sent out a rescue call and the indian warship , which was sailing nearby moved its marine commandos on a helicopter to help the distressed cargo vessel , he said .
the attack took place about 150 nautical miles off aden and ins mysore was about 13 nautical miles away from the merchant vessel when it picked up the sos call .
the navy flew its marine commandos on helicopters to the scene of the pirate attack and rescued the ship. mv gibe was later escorted to safety , he added .
the naval commandos also boarded the pirates ' boats and seized seven ak-47 assault rifles , two other rifles , a grenade launcher and 13 fully loaded magazines of ammunition from the 12 somali and 11 yemeni pirates on board the two pirate boats .
further search for other pirates , who fled from the spot following the indian naval intervention , was in progress , the spokesperson said .
last month , navy warship ins tabar , a missile-frigate , had sunk a mother ship of the pirates and had also rescued two merchant vessels that were under attack from the sea brigands .
after the successful counter attack on the pirates , ins mysore later escorted mv gibe to safety , the navy spokesperson said .
it also launched further search for some of the pirates who escaped after the launch of the marine commando operation .
indian navy has also sought assistance from warships of other countries deployed on anti-piracy patrols in the gulf of aden to catch the runaway brigands , he said .
new delhi had taken a serious view of piracy-related incidents in the gulf of aden , the primary sea lane for global maritime trade to and fro oil-rich west asia , following the abduction of mv stolt valor , which had 18 indian sailors on board , by somali pirates from the region on september 15 , 2008 .
on october 23 , india gave a go-ahead to the navy 's request for a pro-active approach to counter the outlaws operating with audacity in the region along the horn of africa .
the navy rushed its stealth frigate ins tabar , which was already deployed nearby to gulf of aden on november 2 and since then it rescued an indian vessel mv jag arnav and a saudi cargo ship on november 11 and also sunk a pirate 'mother ship ' on november 19 .
the 'first kill ' , as navy chief admiral sureesh mehta had later described the sinking , turned out to be a thai fishing trawler under the pirates ' control carrying a lot of ammunition and it went up in flames after ins tabar fired at it in retaliation .
