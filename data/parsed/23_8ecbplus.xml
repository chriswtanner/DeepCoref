a second man has fallen to his death in aoraki mount cook national park .
the man aged in his early 30s fell about 600m while climbing near the mount sefton bivvy on saturday afternoon .
rescue personnel were not able to reach him or his three companions , who were all from overseas , due to low light levels on saturday , mid - south canterbury area commander inspector dave gaskin said .
"they managed to have a look at him and it was pretty clear that there was no signs of life and they've flown in today to retrieve the body , " he told nz newswire on sunday .
the other three men were rescued by about 10am on sunday morning .
"we haven't been in a position to speak to the survivors at this stage , but it appears as if their equipment and preparation was limited , " insp gaskin said .
it was the second death in the park in two days .
a 36 - year - old man died about 11am on friday after he slipped and fell about 200m down a steep icy gully .
the man , a new zealander living in melbourne , was planning to go ski touring .
two deaths so close together was unusual for the time of year , insp gaskin said .
"we don't normally get too many climbing accidents at this time of year , it's still basically winter conditions here , so there's very little climbing done . " .
the climbing season generally starts about late october / early november .
mr gaskin urged people not to go into situations unprepared .
"this is an extremely dangerous area and if you're going to climb or come into this area and go up high in the mountains , you've got to make sure that you know what you're doing and you've got all the appropriate equipment . " .
