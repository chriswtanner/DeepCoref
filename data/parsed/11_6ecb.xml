turkmens go to the polls sunday in a parliamentary election the west sees as a test of the central asian nation 's commitment to bring about change after decades of isolation .
critics say the poll is a sham and designed to put a gloss of democracy on a government that tolerates no dissent .
all the candidates in sunday 's election represent either the ruling democratic party of turkmenistan , the only party registered in turkmenistan , or a handful of state-approved independents .
europe will be watching the vote closely as it tries to gauge how much business it can do with the gas-rich nation it sees as key to its energy diversification .
