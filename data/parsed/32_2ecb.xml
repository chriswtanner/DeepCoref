a man with a long history of domestic violence has been accused of stabbing his mother and a former girlfriend to death and leaving their bodies in an apartment for several days .
the unlit stove in the independence street apartment had been left on full blast , authorities said , filling it with enough natural gas to cause a significant explosion .
the body of katherine gomes , 61 , and robyn norma mendes , 48 , were discovered on tuesday when police and firefighters responded to calls about the smell of natural gas , according to the bristol district attorney 's office. a space heater had been left turned to high , but it did not ignite the gas .
the man , gary gomes , 35 , is expected to be arraigned today in new bedford district court on two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping .
gomes was arrested on tuesday after investigators said they found him barricaded in a room in mendes 's apartment on philip street with her 12-year-old daughter .
he was with the girl for at least several hours before police arrived , according to gregg miliote , a spokesman for the bristol district attorney .
gomes has been incarcerated at least three times for violent crimes against women in the last four years and at one point was held for 90 days without bail as a danger to society , according to court records .
the alleged fatal stabbing would be at least his third attack against mendes .
in 2005 , gomes was convicted of beating mendes , holding a knife to her throat , and telling her , " you 're never going to leave me , " according to court records .
gomes served 9 months of a 2-1/2 year sentence .
he was released in 2006 and attacked mendes again , dragging her into the woods .
police rescued her with the aid of dogs , according to court records .
mendes went back to prison for 2-1/2 years and was recently released .
in 2004 , gomes was charged with stealing a $ 500 guitar from his sister , jean .
gomes ran into jean and his mother a few days later and he attacked his sister , according to court records .
" defendant became violent and began to choke the victim with both hands around her neck , " the records state .
