thousands of frightened residents flooded makeshift refugee camps in indonesia 's west papua province today after two powerful earthquakes flattened buildings and killed at least one person .
residents camped out in yards and streets outside their homes , and there were some 14,000 refugees across the province , many of whom had fled to higher ground , officials said .
" for the time being there are 14,000 refugees , " governor abraham atururi said , adding that 17 camps had been set up for the displaced in the provincial capital manokwari .
as aid started to arrive , hundreds of aftershocks continued to rattle the coastal city which was hit by the 7.6 and 7.5 magnitude quakes early on sunday , cutting power and prompting a brief tsunami warning .
atururi said a 10-year-old girl was killed and at least 40 people were injured in the earthquakes , which rekindled bitter memories of similar deadly quakes that hit the town in 2002 .
hundreds of government and private buildings were damaged in the quake , as well as seven bridges , two of which collapsed , he said .
four central government ministers arrived by plane bringing 1.5 billion rupiah ( $ a195,900 ) in aid and to survey the damage , officials said .
two tonnes of medicine was also flown in by the health ministry to manokwari 's airport .
in manokwari , many residents were camping outside their homes , but thousands from low-lying areas refused to leave camps on higher ground out of fear of a tsunami .
" i 'm half-dead in my tent .
i want to go home but i 'm scared of a tsunami , " said fisherman 's wife mapahai , 35 , who fled with her husband and six children .
" two of my children are sick , i 'm also sick .
we have n't received any medicine yet , " she said .
indonesia 's meteorology and geophysics agency ( bmg ) said papua had been hit by 842 aftershocks over a period of 29 hours after the first quake , including 54 aftershocks stronger than five on the richter scale .
" it keeps on shaking , " papua bmg spokesman mujahidin said .
some 168,000 people were killed in indonesia 's aceh province and nias island by the 2004 asian tsunami , making it the worst hit country .
