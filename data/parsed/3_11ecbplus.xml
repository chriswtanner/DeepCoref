fallout continues after brazen escape .
the texas department of criminal justice has made sweeping leadership changes at a huntsville prison where an inmate managed to get a gun that he later used to escape , the agency announced tuesday .
the nov . 30 escape by arcade joseph comeaux jr . , a convicted rapist recaptured last month after eight days on the run in baytown and houston , has led to unprecedented fallout at the prison unit where he was housed , with the largest number of tdcj employees ever facing termination or disciplinary action because of a single incident , said tdcj inspector general john moriarty .
comeaux , 49 , escaped from a prison van in baytown after he pulled a gun on two tdcj officers driving him to another prison in beaumont .
he was at large until dec . 7 , when he was found shoeless , wet and hungry at a north houston business , where he asked to use the phone .
so far , 11 estelle unit employees have been recommended for termination or faced consequences related to comeaux's escape .
four of those elected to retire instead of facing disciplinary action , including the two officers who drove comeaux in the van on the day he escaped .
whitmire questioned why several prisons , including the estelle unit , stopped searching visitors two months before comeaux's escape and moved to random pat - downs .
since comeaux's jailbreak , all visitors and employees at the estelle prison unit are again subject to mandatory pat - downs , lyons said .
