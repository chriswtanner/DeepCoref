a waitrose supermarket in a somerset town caught fire yesterday ( july 21st ) , causing substantial damage to the building " s roof .
the fire service was called at approximately 06 : 00 bst to the store , which is on wellington " s high street .
upon arrival they found that the roof fire was quite significant .
fire crews from devon and somerset fire and rescue attended the scene and then called a further four appliances to help , a report from itv revealed .
they contained the fire to one corner of the roof but could not be extinguished before a part of the entrance building collapsed .
however , the main area of the one - storey supermarket was left largely intact with only smoke damage .
by about 09 : 30 bst the fire was largely out , with crews checking for hotspots .
the fire service " s matt goodman explained that the fire began on the outside of the building .
"it then quickly spread to the roof so there is a significant amount of damage to the roof , but thankfully due to the early actions of the wellington crew we could get a large weight of response to the scene , " he said .
"we've been able to prevent it spreading to other areas of the building , so the main store on the inside has got a reasonably small amount of smoke damage . " .
a spokesperson from waitrose explained that no one was hurt in the incident and was grateful to the emergency services for their quick response and effective help .
investigations into what caused the fire are ongoing .
in a bid to remove potential fire hazards , commercial buildings and non - domestic premises in england and wales are already forced to undertake a 'suitable and sufficient' fire risk assessment carried out under the regulatory reform ( fire safety ) order 2005 .
while the overwhelming majority of premises do this , if the assessment is thought to have been carried out to an insufficient extent , the responsible person can face an unlimited fine or up to two years in prison .
