good sized quake at the california geysers .
i felt this one pretty good .
i'm located 25 miles south of the quake .
slow easy rocking for about 6 seconds .
this one is pretty rare for the geysers .
the geysers is one of the most active areas of northern california with small earthquakes hitting the area nearly every week .
a 4 . 4 quake is on the large size for the geysers .
the ugsg website says the largest quake ever to be recorded there was 4 . 5 .
