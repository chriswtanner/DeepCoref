now that fulton county courthouse killer brian nichols has been sentenced to life without parole , one of the not yet answered questions is where the 37-year-old will serve time .
superior court judge james bodiford on saturday suggested that nichols should serve his time in the federal maximum security prison - known as supermax - in florence , colo. , which has the reputation as the nation 's toughest and most secure prison .
bodiford said he was surprised to learn during the trial that nichols , who is committed of state crimes , could still serve his time in a federal prison .
" i thought maybe supermax might be a good place for mr. nichols for what it is worth , " bodiford said .
" i do n't believe i can order it and i am not going to order it but that is my two cents worth . " .
about the prison .
the supermax unit at the florence federal correctional complex at florence , colo. , primarily holds extremely dangerous or escape-risk federal inmates .
there also are a few state prisoners there who need more security than those prisons can provide .
the remote prison , which opened in 1994 , almost disappears into the same-color desert around it .
cells are 8-by-12 feet , with concrete walls , ceilings and furnishings , including the bed .
the toilets , sinks and showers are stainless steel .
cell windows are long and narrow , limiting the view to only the sky .
some known inmates .
unabomber ted kaczynski , shoe bomber richard reid , and sept. 11 , 2001 conspirator zacarias moussaoui .
jamil abdullah al-amin , the 1960s militant once named h. rap brown , convicted in georgia of the state crime of murdering a fulton county deputy .
convicted of federal crimes in georgia : eric robert rudolph , who pleaded guilty to the centennial olympic park bombings and other bombings in atlanta , and malachi z. york , the nuwaubian leader convicted of child molestation , racketeering and federal financial reporting charges .
prison program .
a three-step program limits - or perhaps deprives - inmates of many things that would stimulate the senses - smell , sight and touch .
olympic park bomber rudolph complained in letters to a colorado newspaper in 2006 that the prison 's design was driving him insane .
in the first stage of the program , inmates spend 23 of every 24 hours double-locked behind a steel door and a barred grate .
they are allowed one 15-minute telephone call a month .
one hour each day is spent alone in a recreation area .
their behavior is reviewed every 90 days before they can be moved up to the next step .
at the second and third steps , inmates are given progressively more freedom , more time for exercise , longer and more frequent telephone calls and more social contact with other prisoners - as long as they are free of violations .
limited inmate privileges .
inmates get a radio and a black-and-white , 13-inch television made specially with clear backs that reveal all internal components .
the tvs are hooked up to " basic cable . " .
inmates participate in religious services that are broadcast on their televisions .
guards pass inmates ' meals , law books and other items through a slot in the door .
there is limited direct human contact .
