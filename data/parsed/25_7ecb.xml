the new orleans saints placed running back reggie bush on injured reserve wednesday , ending the former first-round picks season two games short of the year 's finale with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee .
bush missed four games earlier this season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair the meniscus on his left knee and it appears it was injured in the saints ' thursday night loss to chicago .
" right now , for him , it 's going to be rehab and rest with it , " saints head coach sean payton said .
" with two weeks remaining in the season , we thought that was the best way to go with his injury and allowed us acquire another player . " .
payton added , " he would n't be put on ir if we had more than two weeks or three weeks left in the season .
the news is fairly good , which is encouraging . " .
bush was unavailable for comment wednesday and will see dr. james andrews in birmingham , ala. , for further evaluation friday .
he missed games against san diego , atlanta , kansas city and green bay midway through this season after getting injured in new orleans ' 30-7 oct. 19 loss at carolina .
payton pulled bush in the second half of the loss to the bears and following the game , bush expressed frustration with the move .
saints quarterback drew brees understands .
" he was frustrated. he 's not the only one , " brees said .
" there 's a lot of guys who get frustrated when maybe you want to play and you 're not or you know you 're not 100 percent healthy and it 's affecting you .
that frustrates you . " .
" he 's used to being the guy , " brees continued .
" he 's used to being the one everyone counts on in the clutch situations , all the way from high school to college .
that 's what 's in his makeup .
that 's what 's in his blood .
he 's an extremely competitive guy . " .
the former usc running back and heisman trophy winner also missed the final four games of the 2007 season after tearing the posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee .
but payton said the injuries this year are n't related to his injury a year ago and he 's not concerned with the long-term prognosis of the third-year pro .
" we 're encouraged with the overall outlook and not having surgery it appears right now , " payton said .
bush was named an alternate to the nfc pro bowl team on tuesday .
prior to getting injured , bush was having a standout year .
through 14 games in the 2008 season , bush had 404 yards and two touchdowns on 106 carries , averaging 3.8 yards per run .
he also had 440 yards and four touchdowns receiving and had returned three punts for touchdowns .
" i had a long visit with him ( tuesday ) , " payton said .
" just disappointment in the way the season started. certainly it was encouraging .
as we monitor his touches and we look at how many times he gets the ball , be it in the running game and passing game , we 'll find that right balance . " .
