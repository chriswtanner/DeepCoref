the mother of a 10-year-old girl killed by a stray bullet on an albany street last year said she heard a loud sound before her daughter cried out " mommy , mommy , i 've been hit , " and then stumbled down the steps of their apartment .
shondell mcallister on tuesday recalled screaming " somebody help me , my daughter 's been shot . " .
mcallister was the first witness called in the trial of 16-year-old jermayne timmons , who is accused of firing the deadly shot from an intersection down the street .
mcallister described to jurors in albany county court the hectic scene on may 29 as she lay her daughter , kathina thomas , on the sidewalk while she bled from a gunshot wound in her back .
after running to find help , mcallister pushed her way back to kathina through emergency workers , only to be told her youngest daughter was already dead .
prosecutor david rossi said timmons is charged with intentional murder because he intended to kill someone , although kathina was n't the target .
in opening statements tuesday , public defender peter lynch said then- 15-year-old timmons was at the scene of the shooting and had a gun , but is n't the one who fired the fatal shot .
lynch said his client had a .32-caliber revolver , while autopsy results concluded that kathina was killed by a .45-caliber bullet .
timmons , who was arrested 12 days after the shooting , faces a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in prison if convicted .
he 's charged with two counts of second-degree murder , one count each of first- and second-degree manslaughter , and criminal possession of a weapon .
according to authorities , the teenager told police he was with a group of people down the street from kathina 's home when they ran into a rival group and timmons ' fired a shot at them .
the bullet missed its intended target and traveled about a block before hitting kathina .
timmons told police he fired when he thought he saw someone in the other group reach for a gun .
he said the gun he used was kept hidden under a shed and used by " everyone in the neighborhood , " and said he and his friends then rode away on the bikes and he put the gun back .
no gun has been recovered .
prosecutors are bringing the case against timmons without a murder weapon , and rossi noted tuesday that the gun was n't available because the defendant had gotten rid of it .
witnesses for the prosecution said a shell casing found at the intersection where the fatal shot was fired matched the bullet removed from kathina 's body .
