lawman 's unwavering compass led him to white house showdown .
w. mark felt sr. , the associate director of the fbi during the watergate scandal who , better known as " deep throat , " became the most famous anonymous source in american history , died yesterday .
felt died at 12:45 p.m . at his home in santa rosa , calif .
on tuesday , oct. 10 , 1972 , washington awoke to this startling news .
" fbi agents have established that the watergate bugging incident stemmed from a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage conducted on behalf of president nixon 's reelection and directed by officials of the white house and the committee for the re-election of the president , " the washington post reported .
bob woodward and carl bernstein wrote that story , but it would not have been possible , they would later tell the world , without the clandestine help of the most famous unnamed source in history , w. mark felt -- the man they called " deep throat . " .
he was the associate director of the fbi , and he guided the reporters , all along insisting that watergate was not an isolated incident but part of a wider conspiracy designed to destroy democratic presidential candidates who might run against nixon .
instead , the watergate scandal subsequently destroyed the nixon presidency .
facing impeachment , nixon resigned the presidency in disgrace less than two years after that day in october when , one of his key lawyers would later say , it was apparent that " in a general way and with the help of deep throat , ( woodward and bernstein ) figured out watergate . " .
felt died thursday at his home in santa rosa , calif .
he was 95 .
as the second-ranking official in the fbi , felt possessed authoritative knowledge of what came to be known as the watergate conspiracy .
felt had personally witnessed the nixon administration 's attempt to subvert the bureau 's investigation into the complex of crimes and coverups that began unraveling with a 1972 burglary of the democratic national committee 's headquarters at the watergate complex in northwest washington .
" he helped stiffen the spine of the washington post , which went out on a limb more than any other publication did , and broke stories that other outlets shunned , " said mark feldstein , a george washington university faculty member who is writing a book on nixon and the media .
" had woodward not run with it , felt had a network of connections in washington , ( other reporters ) he was talking to ... but no one knew of his connection to woodward . " .
felt , a dashing figure with a full head of silver hair and a reputation as a taskmaster , adamantly denied over the years that he was deep throat , even though nixon suspected him almost from the start .
nixon ordered interim fbi director l. patrick gray to fire felt five times .
but gray , convinced by felt 's denials , never did .
a master of bureaucratic infighting and misdirection , felt seized upon a post story that had not used him as a source .
in a bold stroke , he denounced it in an internal memo and ordered an investigation into the leak .
" expedite , " he commanded .
the next day , in a notation on another memo that passed across his desk , he pointed to a prosecutor as the source of the leak .
" i was impressed .
my guy knew his stuff , " woodward wrote in " secret man : the story of watergate 's deep throat " ( 2006 ) .
" the memo was an effective cover for him , the very best counterintelligence tradecraft .
not only had he initiated the leak inquiry , but felt appeared to have discovered the leaker . " .
felt had insisted on remaining completely anonymous , or on " deep background . " .
a post editor dubbed him " deep throat , " a bit of wordplay based on the title of a pornographic movie of the time .
the source 's existence , but not his identity , became known in woodward and bernstein 's 1974 book , " all the president 's men , " and in the subsequent movie version , in which actor hal holbrook played the charismatic but shadowy source .
it was n't until may 30 , 2005 , that felt 's family revealed his identity in an article for vanity fair magazine .
the story , written by san francisco lawyer john d. o'connor , did not make clear why felt , who was suffering from dementia , admitted his role after more than 30 years .
woodward confirmed the revelation , and the secret was finally out .
