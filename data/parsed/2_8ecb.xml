now that it 's been confirmed that hugh jackman will be hosting the 81st annual academy awards , instantly upping the annual ceremony 's overall attractiveness , the ampersand would like to offer some heartfelt advice to the first-time oscar host .
true , jackman held his own just fine as the host of both the 2004 and 2005 tony awards , earning an emmy for the former , but this is a whole new ballgame .
so without further ado , hugh , a list of dos and don'ts when hosting the academy awards .
do keep jokes tight , snappy and to-the-point , a la jon stewart .
stewart pulled off a television miracle last year when he hosted the 2007 oscars only 11 days after the wga writer 's strike ended , meaning that his jokes and opening speech were last-minute writes .
this did n't seem to dampen stewart 's usual comedic flair .
keeping a constant string of quick ( and often political ) one-liners coming at the audience , who had to keep on their toes so as not to miss anything , he made sure that the ceremonies did n't get bogged down , keeping things lively .
my personal favourite quip .
" oscar is 80 this year , which makes him now automatically the front-runner for the republican nomination . " .
a " john mccain is so old " joke is never in bad taste !
stewart also oozed confidence , despite lackluster reviews of his hosting job in 2006 .
do channel johnny carson .
carson is considered the epitome of the oscar host .
he hosted the ceremony five times and found that magical place where a joke is just biting enough , but does n't sting .
" i see some new faces here , especially on the old ones , " he joked in one opening speech .
see ?
slightly scathing , but playful .
after all , the last thing you want to do is piss off your entire industry .
do allow yourself to get star-struck .
even the hollywood heavy-weights that host the oscars are allowed to be overwhelmed by the folks the statuettes are being presented to .
while obviously a part of her act , there was something very endearing about ellen degeneres pausing in her host spiel to snap a myspace picture of her and clint eastwood and letting the audience know what a thrill the experience of hosting for them was .
nothing 's going to get the audience on your side like admitting they they impress you .
do go big .
hollywood has never been about self-restraint or simplicity .
when celebrating the movie industry you 've got to be lavish .
while jackman has a certain composed air about him and oozes class ( have you seen a picture of him in a tux ? ) he could benefit from a spectacular entrance like whoopi goldberg 's in 1999 ( she waltzed on stage in full queen elizabeth get-up ) .
it 's hollywood : go big , baby .
do watch the time .
since the introduction of the play-off music that cuts award recipients off when they get too long-winded ( is there anything more embarrassing than watching an a-lister chase the microphone as its lowered into the stage in order to get that last thank-you in ? ) , the oscars have been trimmer in recent years .
but just as dangerous as the ceremony going over is it running short .
it happened in 1959 .
then host jerry lewis forced that year 's winners to dance awkwardly around the stage in order to fill the last twenty minutes of his broadcast .
mortifying .
avoid at all costs .
do n't appropriate .
it will always be funny when billy crystal relives the year 's greatest films ( or rather , dodges certain death within them ) in an intricate opening montage .
he 's done it eight times already and it has yet to get old .
that being said , it 's crystal 's thing .
jackman will have to come up with his own trademark hosting quirk .
might i suggest flashy , high-kicking song and dance numbers ?
do n't do anything that david letterman did .
enough said .
do n't be afraid to be abusive or controversial .
while no one ever wants to see a repeat of michael moore 's rant in 2001 , it 's the snippy , daring jokes and comments that are remembered , like steve martin 's improvistation right after the aforementioned tirade .
