colts top jags to make playoffs .
the indianapolis colts will be making their seventh straight playoff appearance after securing that spot with a 31-24 win over the jacksonville jaguars last night in jacksonville .
the colts ( 11-4 ) also won their eighth straight game in defeating the jags ( 5-10 ) who raced out to an early 14-0 lead in the game .
in fact , the colts did n't take their first lead until former gator defensive back keiwan ratliff intercepted a david garrard pass and returned it for a touchdown to give the colts a 31-24 lead .
the jags drove down to the colts 7 yard line but a pass to running back maurice jones-drew was completed and he hurt his knee on the play .
the jags had no timeouts left and by injury rule at that time a 10 second clock runoff was instituted and the game ended .
