sixteen - year - old kimani gray was shot and killed on saturday night after pointing a gun at two plainclothes officers who approached him , police said .

both officers fired a total of 11 shots at the suspect , hitting gray multiple times in his torso and legs .
his sister , mahnefah gray , told ny1 she doubted her brother was carrying a gun , but was rather grabbing his belt " to squeeze it " because he had a " skinny waist . " .
"they thought he was grabbing back to get a gun , " she said .
" he's 16 years old .
what is he pointing a gun at over six police , knowing that they would kill him ?
he has common sense . " .
witnesses said that gray , who was running for his life when he was shot , did not have a gun .
"stay down , or we " ll shoot you again , " police said once gray had been hit , according to the new york times .
