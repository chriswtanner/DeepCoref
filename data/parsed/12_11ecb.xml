the indian navy said it arrested 23 pirates who threatened a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden on saturday , the latest in a series of recent clashes with somali pirates .
indian forces repulsed the pirates as they were about to board the merchant ship , navy spokesman commander nirad sinha said .
the pirates are from somalia and yemen , two countries surrounding the gulf of aden , sinha said .
no further details were immediately available .
last month , india 's navy drew criticism after sinking a thai fishing trawler that had been commandeered hours earlier by pirates .
the navy defended its actions , saying it had fired in self-defense .
somali pirates have become increasingly brazen in recent months , seizing a number of vessels including a saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million worth of crude oil .
somalia , an impoverished nation caught up in an islamic insurgency , has not had a functioning government since 1991 .
