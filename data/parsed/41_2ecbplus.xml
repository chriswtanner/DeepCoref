unhcr condemns air attack on refugee camp in south sudan .
11 november 2011 .
the un refugee agency on friday strongly condemned the aerial bombing of a temporary refugee camp in south sudan sheltering more than 20 , 000 civilians fleeing from conflict in neighbouring sudan's nuba mountains .
"two of the bombs fell within the yida camp , including one close to the school , " said unhcr spokesman adrian edwards .
"fortunately there were no casualties in the camp and we are verifying the situation of surrounding communities , " he told journalists in geneva .
unhcr had been readying new refugee sites away from the border in unity state when the incident occurred on thursday .
"we had hoped to begin the relocation of refugees but our efforts have so far been hampered by heavy rains which have made the road to the camp impassable , " edwards explained .
the refugee agency is concerned by the escalating tensions in the border areas between sudan and south sudan , where hundreds of thousands of civilians have been uprooted since june as a result of fighting .
there are also reports this week of bombing in new guffa village of south sudan's upper nile state resulting in civilian casualties .
as many as 55 , 000 civilians originating from the damazine and kurmuk areas are said to be moving southwards in sudan's blue nile state .
some of these people are heading to chali within blue nile state .
others are crossing into new guffa village , nine kilometres from the border , or bunj , the capital of maban county in south sudan's upper nile state .
others may be moving into neighbouring ethiopia , where more than 30 , 000 sudanese have found refuge and are being helped by unhcr and its partners .
new arrivals in maban county describe empty villages south of kurmuk town on the other side of the border .
the new arrivals are being registered in bunj , where unhcr has a way station as well as a warehouse that holds enough supplies for 15 , 000 refugees .
un assessment teams are planning to travel to maban over the weekend to assess the humanitarian conditions for new arrivals .
meanwhile , local authorities have been identifying temporary reception sites as more arrivals are anticipated amid heightened tensions .
