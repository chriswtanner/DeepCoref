she was the wholesome face of america 's kinky secret -- even if no one saw that face for half a century .
bettie page , the notorious southern gal-turned-dominatrix-turned pin-up-queen-turned born again christian , died thursday at age 85 .
the details of her death are known .
she had been hospitalized in los angeles for four weeks due to pneumonia , only to suffer from a heart attack .
far less is known of her life -- at least the last five decades of it .
in 1957 , page disappeared from the flash of the cameras and the public spotlight .
she 'd found religion , became a recluse , and lost contact with friends and associates .
but in the short time she donned panties and garters , brandished a whip and a whip-smart attitude , she was the queen of kink .
page , you see , was to erotica what elvis was to rock 'n ' roll .
no , she was n't the first pin-up .
she was n't even the best looking .
but she had " that thing " that could take what was once a dark art form into the american mainstream .
unlike elvis , though , page never got bloated .
she checked out in her prime .
she did n't even allow to have her photo taken .
she remained frozen in time .
yet , her image continues to strut its black stilettos through pop culture .
" bettie page " remains short-hand for a haircut , an image and a cult that includes everyone and everything -- from designer vivienne westwood to rockabilly hounds to hot-rodders , comic books , madonna , goths , neo-burlesque performers and devil-may-care types .
the nashville , tenn. , girl never imagined she 'd ever stir such a fuss .
" she looked so fresh and wholesome , " said bunny yeager , whose photographs of page appeared in virtually every men 's magazine in the nineteen fifties .
" she was n't trying to be seductive ; she was the girl next door . " .
one big difference between page and most neighbors , said yeager .
" she felt more comfortable in the nude than in clothes . " .
her story of unintentional notoriety began in 1950 , when she boarded a greyhound bound for manhattan .
within months , her innocent face and curvy body made her the hit of the " camera-club circuit . " .
" back then , you 'd have a bunch of guys with cameras travel by bus to private houses to photograph girls , " yeager said .
an aesthetic was born , one that mixed mundane suburbia with raw sexuality .
by 1952 , page was breaking taboos , posing with a ball strapped in her mouth , whip in hand and devilish look on face -- in photos and movies that featured stripping , spanking and faux lesbianism that straddled burlesque and pornography .
page was hardly tawdry , though , yeager said .
" she was so at ease , so wholesome . " .
the traits made a page a natural in natural settings captured by yeager , who met page in 1954 .
yeager 's shots of her in a jungle swimsuit with two cheetahs are '50s exotica par excellence : a mix of the innocence and the wild that shot through the veins of american sexuality , not to mention pin-up art , hot-rod aesthetics and tiki culture .
playboy magazine not only featured page pictorials ; it adopted her " girl next door " charm as its manifesto .
page 's good-girl-bad-deed notoriety turned her into a marilyn monroe with black , wicked hair .
too wicked for the u.s. government , which condemned photos of her taken by irving klaw as " obscene and lewd . " .
the controversy drove page from modeling and into the arms of jesus .
" one night while walking the beach she saw a neon cross on a church and walked inside , " yeager said .
she never walked out : page became born again , moved to california , and disappeared from the pages and the public eye .
but her image never stopped titillating .
you see it in rock clubs , roller derby games , fashion shows .
and you see it in an america 's own sexual conflicts -- a nation with a puritanical past and a closet full of sin .
even in death , bettie page is the missing link between the two .
