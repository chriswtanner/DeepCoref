undersea cables damage disrupts internet services in egypt .
internet services in egypt have been disrupted due to damage of undersea cables in the mediterranean sea , the egyptian national telecommunication regulatory authority said friday .
up to 80 percent of internet services and call centers in egypt have been cut after the submarine cables were damaged south of italy on friday for unknown reason , said the egyptian mena news agency .
the egyptian side has contacted the international companies running the cables to give a repair report , mena quoted an official source as saying , adding internet services in egypt is expected to improve in 12 hours .
earlier in the day , egyptian minister of communications and information technology tareq kamel ordered to set up an operation room to follow up the repair works , which are carried out by an international marine cable repair company .
egypt is also trying to switch its internet service to a backup route via southeast asia and satellite .
egypt is constructing another undersea cable , namely te-north , to connect the northern egyptian port city of alexandria and the southeastern french city of marseille , said mena .
it is the second time in 2008 that egypt witnessed a large scale internet services cut due to submarine cable damage .
in january , internet services and international calls were also partly cut in egypt , along with a number of countries in the middle east and south asia .
