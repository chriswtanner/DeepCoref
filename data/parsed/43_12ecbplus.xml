amd to acquire server innovator seamicro .
february 29th , 2012 .
in a bold move to boost its position in next - generation servers , amd will acquire low - power server specialist seamicro for $334 million , the companies said today .
the acquisition is a disruptive one for the low - power server landscape , as seamicro has been using intel chips in its next - generation servers , which offer dramatic reductions in power and space usage .
the crown jewel in the acquisition is seamicro " s networking fabric , which allows hundreds of low - power processors to work together .
the seamicro architecture is processor - neutral , meaning it can be quickly adapted to work with amd " s technology .
" by acquiring seamicro , we are accelerating amd " s transformation into an agile , disruptive innovator capable of staking a data center leadership position , " said rory read , president and ceo , amd .
" seamicro is a pioneer in low - power server technology .
" we are clearly skating to where the puck is going , " read added .
" this is a great company with innovative ip and great talent . " .
the importance of the cloud .
amd plans to offer the first amd opteron processor - based solutions that combine amd and seamicro technology in the second half of 2012 .
the company said it remains firmly committed to its traditional server business , and will continue to invest in research and development .
but amd executives said the acquisition of seamicro will boost the company " s offerings for cloud computing providers , who are keenly focused on reducing the energy used by their armadas of servers .
" cloud data centers are the fastest growing segment of the server market , " said lisa su , senior vice president and general manager , global business units .
" the cloud has changed the dynamics of the data center and how people think about servers . " .
su said amd will offer seamicro servers with amd chips to provide continuity for existing customers .
but the primary focus will be on integrating seamicro " s fabric technology with amd processors in " building blocks " for its oem customers .
downsized " building block " .
the basic building block of the seamicro system is a credit card - sized compute block , comprised of a cpu and its chipset , dram , and a custom seamicro asic ( application specific integrated circuit ) .
seamicro " s patented i / o virtualization allows companies to save money by using fewer cables and network interface cards ( nics ) to connect to networks and storage .
seamicro " s early systems featured up to 768 intel atom cores in a 10u server .
it recently introduced a server powered by 64 intel xeon processors , providing a " brawny " offering to supplement the " wimpy " atom nodes .
one of the benefits of the amd acquisition is the ability to adapt seamicro " s technology to a broader range of workloads and applications , according the seamicro ceo andrew feldman .
" seamicro was founded to dramatically reduce the power consumed by servers , while increasing compute density and bandwidth , " said feldman , who will become general manager of amd " s newly created data center server solutions business .
" by becoming a part of amd , we will have access to new markets , resources , technology , and scale that will provide us with the opportunity to work tightly with our oem partners as we fundamentally change the server market . " .
