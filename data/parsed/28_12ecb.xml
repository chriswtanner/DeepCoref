mark felt , 'deep throat ' in watergate reports , dies .
former fbi official had storied role in washington post investigation that brought down nixon .
w. mark felt , the former fbi official who ended one of the united states ' most intriguing political mysteries when he identified himself as " deep throat " -- the nickname for the anonymous source who helped guide the washington post 's pulitzer prize-winning investigation into the watergate scandal -- has died .
he was 95 .
a controversial figure who was later convicted of authorizing illegal activities in pursuit of members of the radical weather underground , felt died of heart failure thursday at his home in santa rosa , calif . , his grandson rob jones said .
felt was deputy associate director of the fbi in 1972 when he began supplying information to bob woodward , who with carl bernstein made up the post 's investigative duo who doggedly pursued the story of the watergate break-in and a conspiracy that led directly to president richard m. nixon , who ultimately resigned .
the reporters continued to keep felt 's name a secret , but in 2005 , at the age of 91 , felt told vanity fair magazine , " i 'm the guy they used to call deep throat . " .
his disclosure ended a mystery that had intrigued washington insiders and journalists for three decades and provided the grist for many hotly debated newspaper and magazine articles .
while felt 's name was raised as a suspect on several occasions , he always managed to deflect attention , usually by saying that if had been deep throat he would have done a better job of exposing the wrongdoings at the white house .
his disclosure in a vanity fair article by his family 's lawyer , john d. o'connor , provoked a national debate .
was he a hero who should be lauded for sparing the country the strain of further high crimes and misdemeanors by the nixon white house ?
or was he a traitor who betrayed not only his president but his oath of office by disclosing grand jury information and the contents of fbi files ?
for the most part , reaction split along political lines .
" there 's nothing heroic about breaking faith with your people , " said commentator patrick j. buchanan , a former nixon speechwriter .
felt " disgraced himself and dishonored everything an fbi agent should stand for . " .
but richard ben-veniste , a key lawyer in the watergate prosecution team , said felt 's role showed that " the importance of whistle-blowers should n't be underestimated , particularly when there are excesses by the executive branch of government -- which in this case went all the way to the executive office . " .
felt 's moment in history began to unfold shortly after five men in business suits were arrested at the watergate complex in washington on june 17 , 1972 , after breaking into the offices of the democratic national committee .
nixon press secretary ron ziegler dismissed the incident as " a third-rate burglary , " but details gradually tumbled out tying the burglars to the president 's re-election campaign .
misdeeds in the white house were uncovered , hearings were conducted in the house of representatives and senate , and for the first time in american history a president was forced to resign .
the relationship that defined a generation in journalism began about 1970 when woodward was a navy lieutenant assigned to the pentagon as a watch officer .
in his book , " the secret man : the story of watergate 's deep throat , " published after the vanity fair article appeared , woodward wrote that he met felt when he delivered a package of documents to the white house and struck up a conversation with him in a waiting room .
from that initial meeting , woodward cultivated a friendship that would pay off handsomely after he entered journalism .
felt began to provide tips to woodward when he was a cub reporter at the montgomery county sentinel , a suburban maryland newspaper , and later at the post , where he was tipped by felt on stories about the investigation of the 1972 shooting of george c. wallace , the alabama governor then running for president .
when woodward was assigned to the watergate break-in , he again pressed felt for help .
his request came during a crucial moment in the fbi 's history .
felt 's mentor , the legendary founding director j. edgar hoover , had died the month before the break-in , and assistant attorney general l. patrick gray iii had been named acting director .
felt feared -- and his suspicions were later proven right -- that gray was too close to the nixon administration to conduct an uncompromised investigation .
felt agreed to help woodward but only on " deep background , " a term meaning that " the information could be used , " woodward wrote , " but no source of any kind would be identified in the newspaper . " .
felt insisted on using covert rules he had learned while working in the fbi 's espionage section during world war ii .
if woodward needed to talk to felt , he would move a flower pot with a red cloth flag in it to the front of his apartment balcony .
if felt needed to talk to the reporter -- to correct something the post had written or to convey other information -- he would circle page 20 in woodward 's home-delivered copy of the new york times and draw clock hands on the page to indicate the time of the meeting .
he resisted telephone contact in favor of clandestine 2 a.m. encounters at an underground parking garage in rosslyn , virginia .
the two met from june 19 , 1972 -- two days after the break-in -- to november 1973 , five months after felt left the fbi .
within the paper , only woodward and bernstein knew the identity of deep throat , a name borrowed from a notorious pornographic movie of the era .
but felt dealt only with woodward , and bernstein did not meet him until 2008 .
when nixon left office on aug. 9 , 1974 , the two reporters shared the secret with post editor benjamin c. bradlee , who until then had only known that the source was a high justice department official .
nixon , according to woodward , had suspected felt of being the confidential source and assumed him to be part of a jewish cabal out to get him .
according to vanity fair , felt had no religious affiliation .
