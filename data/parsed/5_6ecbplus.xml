ncaa : improper gifts , assistance given to athletes .
updated : may 16 , 2005 , 6 : 03 pm et .
the ncaa notified ohio state on monday of nine alleged rules violations , including cash gifts , improper academic assistance and failure of the school and coaches to monitor the men's basketball program .
seven of the violations involved men's basketball , including a school booster allegedly giving cash and academic help to a former player .
the others involved a booster allegedly giving $500 to a football player , and an orthodontist providing free and discounted services to five women's basketball players .
ohio state previously said it was looking into many of the alleged violations , including a cash gift to a recruit from former basketball coach jim o'brien , who was fired after acknowledging the payment .
"the allegations set forth in this report are consistent with what we expected , " ohio state president karen holbrook said at a news conference .
the school must respond to the allegations by july 26 , and an infractions committee will hold a hearing before determining whether sanctions are warranted , ncaa spokesman erik christianson said .
ohio state's athletic department has faced a series of ncaa investigations of its high - profile sports since the football team won the national championship in 2002 .
in december , the school imposed a one - year postseason tournament ban on its men's basketball team after o'brien acknowledged he gave about $6 , 000 to recruit alex radojevic in 1999 .
o'brien , fired on june 8 , is seeking up to $6 million in a breach - of - contract suit against ohio state .
the ncaa report says o'brien allegedly gave radojevic the money through then - assistant coach paul biancardi .
o'brien and biancardi are accused of acting "contrary to principles of ethical conduct" by failing to report their involvement in ncaa rules violations , the report said .
"we deny that we engaged in any improper conduct under ncaa bylaws and legislation , " said biancardi's attorney , james zeszutek .
biancardi has cooperated fully with ncaa investigators and is barred by the ncaa from publicly discussing the allegations , zeszutek said .
a message seeking comment was left with o'brien's attorney .
former star running back maurice clarett and other former football players have alleged that athletes received money from boosters , got academic credit for work they didn't do and received no - show jobs at high salaries .
the only mention of the football program in the ncaa report is an allegation that $500 was given to a football player , whose name was withheld .
last season , quarterback troy smith was suspended from the alamo bowl for accepting money from a booster .
athletic director gene smith , who replaced andy geiger a month ago , said the allegations in the ncaa report were less serious than speculation indicated .
"what you see before you is what they found in football , " he said , adding he would be surprised if sanctions are imposed against the football team .
clarett was suspended for the 2003 season for lying to investigators during an ncaa probe of allegations that he received improper benefits from a family friend .
