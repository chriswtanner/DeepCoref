precision and perfection defined colts quaterback peyton manning 's start against the jacksonville jaguars. he completed his first 17 passes .
meanwhile , inconsistency and an inability to score at the end of the game defined jaguars quarterback david garrard 's thursday night .
" it 's a 60-minute game -- he played a really good game for 3 1/2 quarters , " colts defensive back antoine bethea said .
the jaguars led for three quarters , but 17 unanswered points in the fourth did them in .
manning completed 29 of 34 passes for 364 yards and 3 touchdowns in the colts ' 31-24 victory over the jaguars at jacksonville municipal stadium .
jacksonville fell to 5-10 on its way to its first losing year since coach jack del rio 's initial season ( 5-11 ) in 2003 .
the loss ended a sordid home campaign in which the jaguars went 2-6 .
the colts ( 11-4 ) , on an eight-game winning streak , clinched a playoff berth .
tony dungy became the first coach since the 1970 merger to take his team to the playoffs in 10 consecutive years .
garrard threw for a career-high 329 yards , but late in the fourth quarter he made costly mistakes .
after scoring on four of their first five drives , including their first two , the jaguars punted to start the fourth quarter .
on their next drive , with 4:48 remaining in the game , garrard threw an interception to defensive back keiwan ratliff , who returned the pick 35 yards for a touchdown .
" it was actually man-coverage , and he made a smart play by dropping off of dennis [ northcutt ] , " garrard said .
" you never see that in man coverage .
they know we like the slant game on that down and distance and they watched tape . " .
the score gave indianapolis its first lead of the game .
garrard finished with 28 completions on 41 attempts , a touchdown and an interception .
the jaguars had one final chance to win the game , fielding a colts punt with 2:34 remaining .
but with 12 seconds left , garrard dropped back to pass and found colts defensive end dwight freeney on top of him , nine yards behind the line of scrimmage .
the sack ended the game .
" i did n't even see it coming , " garrard said .
" so i could n't use my legs to make a play . " .
for the second home game in a row , the jaguars started aggressively .
they won the coin toss , and then elected to receive , just like they did against the green bay packers on sunday .
then they scored immediately , just like they did on sunday .
on their second drive , the jaguars scored again , jumping to a 14-0 lead with a 2-yard touchdown run by garrard .
despite the colts ' passing perfection , indianapolis could n't score .
" this is a funny game , " manning said .
" we were completing some passes , but were down 14-0 .
so that dominated our thoughts . " .
in the second half , manning really went to work .
he threw two touchdown passes and set up a game-tying 45-yard field goal by adam vinatieri .
and any time the colts needed something to happen , they went to their passing game .
running plays were unreliable .
the jaguars could stop those .
the colts gained just 32 yards rushing .
but the passes baffled the jaguars ' defense , sailing at the most important times to exactly where they needed to be .
" peyton manning is a good quarterback , " jaguars safety reggie nelson said .
" he has always been good .
that 's what he does . " .
