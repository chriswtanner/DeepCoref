he sings , dances , acts on stage and screen , and he 's the " sexiest man alive . " .
hugh jackman does everything but standup comedy - and that 's why the first-time oscars host fulfills the academy 's promise to shake up the show in a way that 's as tough to predict as the winners .
jackman was announced friday as the host of the 81st academy awards , a marked departure from the academy 's standard of big-name comedians .
jon stewart , who hosted in 2008 and 2006 , and ellen degeneres , the 2007 host , were the latest in a line of funny emcees since 1990 .
billy crystal did it eight times , whoopi goldberg took on four , steve martin did it twice and david letterman and chris rock each had a shot .
as the parade of a-list comedians continued , ratings were in steady decline .
but with new producers , a new director , new set designer and even a new music director , the academy has been hinting for months at an all-new look and feel for this year 's oscars telecast on feb. 22 .
having jackman host certainly fits with that theme .
producers laurence mark and bill condon called the australian actor " a consummate entertainer and an internationally renowned movie star . " .
" he also has style , elegance and a sense of occasion , " mark and condon said in a joint statement .
" hugh is the ideal choice to host a celebration of the year 's movies - and to have fun doing it . " .
indeed , jackman can be a mutant superhero ( wolverine from the " x-men " movie franchise ) , a flirtatious singing barker ( billy bigelow in rodgers and hammerstein 's musical " carousel " ) , a determined magician ( " the prestige " ) and a dancing penguin ( " happy feet " ) .
the 40-year-old actor plays a roughhewn cattle driver opposite nicole kidman 's english aristocrat in the new baz luhrmann romantic adventure " australia . " .
jackman was abroad promoting the film friday when his oscar role was announced .
" thirty years ago when i was in sydney watching johnny carson host the oscars with my family , i never imagined that i 'd one day have the chance to be up on that stage myself , " he said in a statement .
" i am very grateful to the academy for giving me this opportunity .
and , excited to be working with larry and bill on what i know will be a fun and memorable celebration . " .
having an entertainer such as jackman host the show necessitates a change in the well-established standard of opening the show with a jokes , said steve pond , author of the 2005 book " the big show : high times and dirty dealings backstage at the academy awards . " .
" the tricky part is that while he 's charming , he 's not the kind of guy to go out there and deliver a comic monologue at the top of the show , " pond said .
" he 's more comfortable with a song and dance , but is a song and dance at the top of the oscars what people want to see ?
it 'll be tricky adopting what he does best to what works at the oscars . " .
but with ratings dropping for all awards shows , it 's worth shaking things up to generate interest - and the academy awards telecast , which posted its lowest ratings ever in february , is n't the only one trying something new .
the emmys added a category - best reality-show host - and divvied the show 's hosting duties among the five nominees .
the results were disastrous .
critics panned the format and the show was one of the least-watched emmys ever .
the grammy awards spiced up its nominations earlier this month by trading its typical staid press conference for a glitzy , live concert special .
ratings-wise , the hourlong show came in fourth among prime-time contenders , behind such dramas as nbc 's " life " and abc 's " private practice . " .
bringing in jackman to host the academy awards is " a stretch for the oscars , but at this stage , it 's worth taking the risk , " pond said .
" he certainly has what it takes to do the gig if some changes are made in what that gig requires . " .
jackman also has award-winning hosting experience .
he won an emmy in 2005 for hosting the 58th annual tony awards in 2004 , when he also took a best-actor tony for his performance in the musical " the boy from oz .
" jackman has never been an oscar nominee , but was nominated for a golden globe for his role in 2001 's romantic film " kate and leopold . " .
he also served as a past presenter on the oscar show .
jackman and his wife , deborra-lee furness , have their own oscar at home - their 8-year-old son , oscar maximillian .
the couple also have a 3-year-old daughter ava .
