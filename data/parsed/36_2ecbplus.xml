august 10 , 2011 - - updated 0947 gmt ( 1747 hkt ) .
polygamist leader warren jeffs was sentenced tuesday to life in prison plus 20 years for sexually assaulting two girls he claimed were his "spiritual wives . " .
jeffs , 55 , will have to spend at least 45 years in prison before being eligible for release , according to jerry strickland , spokesman for the texas attorney general's office .
the jury sentenced jeffs to life in prison for aggravated sexual assault of a 12 - year - old girl and 20 years in prison for the sexual assault of a 15 - year - old girl .
he must serve at least 35 years of the life sentence and half of the other sentence , strickland said .
the judge in the case ordered that the sentences be served consecutively .
"justice has been served , " jeffs' nephew , brent jeffs , told insession soon after the sentence .
he testified during the penalty phase of his uncle's trial that jeffs raped him when he was 5 years old .
"i finally had this day and it was an awesome day in court to be here , involved in all of this , " said brent jeffs , now 28 .
jeffs perverted his position as the head of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter - day saints to "satisfy his own personal appetites and desires , " prosecutor eric nichols said .
those appetites included forcing sex on the two girls , 12 and 15 , who he had taken as wives , prosecutors said .
audiotapes seized from his car and the church's yearning for zion ranch compound in eldorado , texas , and played for jurors during his trial , depicted jeffs offering "celestial marriage" instructions to the young wives , according to prosecutors .
"you have to know how to be sexually excited and to help each other . . . and you have to be ready for the time i need your comfort , " a man's voice says .
"this is your mission .
this is how you abide the law .
at one point , the man says , "take your clothes off .
do it right now , " followed by the sounds of crying .
"just don't think about the pain ; you're going to heaven , " the man says .
"rarely if ever in the criminal justice system in texas have we ever encouraged a person such as warren jeffs , whose criminal conduct spans decades , multiple jurisdictions and hundreds of victims , " nichols said .
a former member of the church , rebecca musser , said the verdict will not bring back lost innocence .
but she said it can help others escape from abuse they may have suffered .
"whether the currency is god or greed , the trafficking of women and children for sex is a form of slavery , " she said .
jeffs is the eighth person from the ranch to be convicted on sexual assault , bigamy and other charges , according to the texas attorney general's office .
four others are awaiting trial .
attorney general greg abbott said he believes authorities have rooted out the molesters from the ranch , but will continue to monitor the church's activities there .
"we have an ongoing open investigation that will evaluate all evidence about any kind of wrongdoing out there at the compound whatsoever , " abbott said .
jurors came back with the sentence after 30 minutes of deliberations tuesday .
they began their work tuesday morning following brief closing statements by prosecutor nichols .
jeffs , who has argued that he and his faith were being persecuted , instructed his attorneys to deliver no closing statement .
"this is not the prosecution to persecute a people , this is a prosecution to protect a people , " nichols told jurors .
jeffs did not attend the closing statement .
in addition to tape recordings that the state said depicted sex acts with minors , prosecutors also presented evidence that jeffs knew he was wanted by federal authorities and that his behavior would be shunned by outsiders .
fbi special agent john broadway testified that jeffs ordered the destruction of various discs and transcripts three days after an arrest warrant was issued for him on june 10 , 2005 .
the polygamist sect leader established "houses of hiding , " allegedly with young girls for him to marry , broadway said .
the fbi agent also read from a priesthood record , in which jeffs allegedly wrote : "things are happening so quickly .
there is an even younger girl that the lord wants me to take .
she is 13 .
for some reason the lord is sending me these girls that can be worked with . " .
jeffs also wrote : "if the world knew what i was doing , they would hang me from the highest tree , " according to evidence presented in court .
referring to that comment , prosecutor nichols said during his closing statement that "yes , this is texas .
but no , we don't hang convicts anymore from the highest tree , and we don't have the ability to call down the wrath of the almighty . . .
we as a people choose to isolate our worst offenders , to keep them away from their past and future victims . " .
jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10 , 000 followers .
their practice of polygamy , which the mainstream mormon church renounced more than a century ago , is part of the sect's doctrine .
