as i said many times in my review , gary ross ‘ direction was the strongest element of the hunger games .
but for lionsgate , the movie " s ability to make a crazy amount of money was the strongest element of the hunger games .
now , thr is reporting that ross and the studio are locked in tense negotiations over his return to direct the sequel , catching fire .
lead actors jennifer lawrence , josh hutcherson , and liam hemsworth are already signed for catching fire ( and i imaging they " re also signed for the third installment , mockingjay ) , but ross doesn " t have a deal in place .
he was paid $3 million for co - writing and directing the film plus 5 percent on the back - end .
unsurprisingly , he would like a raise on the sequel .
hit the jump for more including why catching fire might not make its november 22 , 2013 release date .
according to thr , negotiations on the first film were tough because ross already had a successful , oscar - nominated movie to his name ( seabiscuit ) , but lionsgate had never paid a hefty filmmaker salary before ( hunger games was the highest - budgeted project in the studio " s history ) .
now that hunger games will undoubtedly be one of the highest - grossing films of the year , ross has some leverage , but current franchise trends aren " t moving in his favor .
other major franchises have shown no hesitation in constantly switching out directors .
after all , it " s the title that draws people into the theaters , not the filmmaker .
harry potter went through four directors as did twilight , and marvel has basically made it a policy never to rehire any of their directors .
the studio " s highest priority is making sure to keep the franchise flowing without delay , and prolonged negotiations with ross may cause a delay .
there " s also the added problem of ross taking time to revise simon beaufoy ‘ s script for catching fire .
lionsgate is also facing an issue with the sequel " s scheduled november 22 , 2013 release date .
fox could stymie lionsgate " s plans by exercising lawrence " s option to do the sequel for x - men : first class .
sources tell thr that fox " s option would take priority over lionsgate " s .
lionsgate is aiming to get catching fire into production by the fall , but fox already has their director ready to go ( matthew vaughn is signed to return for first class 2 ) .
however , first class 2 doesn " t have a release date .
ross " does have a few counters against lionsgate .
first , he " s a known quantity and has established a relationship with the cast and crew .
he also delivered a critically well - received movie .
granted , the hunger games would have crushed at the box office no matter what , but the positive response indicates that he " s now in higher demand for other properties .
it " s an impressive boost for a director who hadn " t helmed a project since seabiscuit in 2003 .
despite the acrimony , a source tells thr that the two sides will eventually make a deal .
ultimately , it will be difficult , and yet everybody will do the sane thing , which is to work it out , " says one .
" everybody will end up unhappy in their own way .
it " s just the nature of the beast . " .
the alternative is to throw 24 directors into an arena and have them fight to the death .
and if you " re having trouble imagining other directors taking over the franchise , take a look at these fake posters for the hunger games .
