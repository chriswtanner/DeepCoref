severed cables in mediterranean disrupt communication .
internet and telephone communications between the middle east and europe were disrupted after three submarine cables between italy and egypt in the mediterranean sea were damaged .
the failures cut the flow of " data of various kinds " between europe and the middle east , and there 's no timeframe for when communications will be restored , said sanjeev gaur , director of assurance at reliance globalcom ltd. in india .
france telecom sa , which plans to send a maintenance boat to fix the problem , said the situation should be back to normal by dec. 31 .
three cable systems carrying more than 75 percent of traffic between the middle east , europe and america have been damaged , according to the u.k. 's interoute plc , which operates a fiber- optic data network connecting 92 cities .
the cables run from alexandria in northern egypt to sicily in southern italy .
in january , an anchor severed the cables outside alexandria after bad weather conditions forced ships to moor off the coast .
" the information we have is a bit sketchy , but chances are that it will have been an anchor again , " jonathan wright , interoute 's director of wholesale products , said in a telephone interview .
" close to 90 percent of all the data traffic between europe and the middle east is carried on these three cable systems . " .
interoute said the january incident brought down 70 percent of the internet network in india and the middle east .
customer services and some mobile-phone customers at vodafone group plc 's egyptian unit are affected by the cable failure , said simon gordon , a spokesman for the u.k. company .
egypt is the only country where the company is aware of any problems linked to the failure , he said .
most mobile-phone calls are routed through fixed-line cables at some point .
verizon communications inc. , the second-largest u.s. phone company , said it has rerouted traffic for its verizon business customers making calls to the middle east by siphoning it to europe and the u.s. and then down through asia , spokeswoman linda laughlin said in an interview .
the rerouting slowed some traffic to about half its normal speed , laughlin said .
point-to-point customers still do n't have connections , and verizon does n't have information on how many subscribers are affected .
the company expects repairs to be completed by early next week , she said .
portugal telecom sgps sa , portugal 's biggest phone company , has redirected traffic through other cables in the region and therefore the " impact is very small , " said a company official .
sonaecom sgps sa , portugal 's second-biggest fixed-line phone company , also said that it 's diverting traffic to other routes .
france telecom 's orange mobile-phone unit said the cable failure " greatly disturbed " the traffic between europe and parts of asia .
at one point as much as 55 percent of voice traffic in saudi arabia , 52 percent in egypt and 82 percent in india was out of service , according to orange .
internet traffic " from mumbai to london has now been rerouted via hong kong which may lead to congestion and increased latency on this route , " .
reliance said in an e-mailed " traffic disruption update , " adding that it is working with the affected customers to restore all services .
the company said it will publish another update on its web site tomorrow .
" you can reroute the data through other cables , but that increases traffic and can potentially create bottlenecks , " interoute 's wright said .
" so internet connections may slow down and some phone calls could get disrupted . " .
some of interoute 's clients in the u.k. and southern france are probably affected by the failure , wright said .
" it 's difficult to forecast how long it will take to fix the problem as it depends on the weather and sea conditions in the mediterranean , " wright said .
a fault is affecting the smw4 cable near the alexandria cable station , the flag fea cable is down and the smw3 cable system is also affected , according to information received from telstra .
flag telecom group ltd. , a reliance globalcom unit , operates flag fea and the other cables are owned by groups of phone companies across the regions .
reliance globalcom does n't know exactly what happened and engineers are working on the problem , said anurag joshi , head of the company 's global network operations center .
the smw4 cable , also known as sea-me-we 4or south east asia-middle east-western europe 4 cable network , connects 12 countries : pakistan , indonesia , singapore , malaysia , bangladesh , india , sri lanka , united arab emirates , saudi arabia , egypt , italy and france .
france telecom said one of its maintenance boats in the mediterranean area is headed to the region for a relief mission with 20 kilometers of spare cable on board .
priority will be to recover the sea-me-we 4 cable , then the sea-me-we 3 cable , france telecom said , adding that sea me we4 could be operating by dec. 25 and the situation should be back to normal by dec. 31 .
