bush placed on injured reserve .
the saints placed running back reggie bush on injured reserve ending his season .
the decision was made after bush met with dr. james andrews this past week .
bush injured his left knee on oct. 19 and had arthroscopic surgery to fix a torn meniscus and missed four games .
he was bothered by the knee last week against the bears and did n't play in the second half .
pierre thomas will get most of the carries and is an excellent play against the lions this week .
