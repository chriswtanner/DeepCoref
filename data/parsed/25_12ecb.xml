the new orleans saints placed reggie bush on injured reserve today , officially ending his third nfl season .
it 's the second straight year that bush failed to make it to the last week of the season .
it 's also the second straight year that bush took steps backward after a strong rookie season .
bush , who missed several games after arthroscopic knee surgery earlier this season , wraps up the year with 404 yards rushing and 440 yards receiving .
he scored six touchdowns on offense and added three more on punt returns .
there 's nothing wrong with nine touchdowns in 10 games , but bush 's inability to stay on the field has made him something less than the saints expected with the second overall pick in the 2006 draft .
leon washington of the jets , a fourth-rounder that year , has turned in similar production as bush this season ( in more games ) but costs his team much less money .
making matters worse is the fact that the relationship between bush and coach sean payton seems to be deteriorating .
bush expressed unhappiness about being yanked from last week 's loss to the bears , two weeks after payton made a similar move against the bucs .
whatever his shortcomings , bush could still play an important role in the supercharged saints offense .
unless he loses payton 's faith once and for all , of course .
