not because mo cheeks was long for the job with the philadelphia 76ers .
like all coaches not in the upper stratosphere of the coaching hierarchy -- your phil jacksons and gregg popoviches -- he was only as good as his last 10-game stretch , only as secure as how well his star was playing .
but the 76ers , while underachieving at 9-14 when cheeks was fired saturday morning , were not an embarassment when they went on the court , not a disjointed bunch that clearly was no longer listening to or playing for its coach .
this was n't p.j. carlesimo ( oklahoma city ) or eddie jordan ( washington ) , whose team 's putrid won-loss records sank any chance they had of survival .
this was n't sam mitchell ( toronto ) , whose differences of opinion with his general manager about his team 's personnel were too big to overcome .
this was n't randy wittman ( minnesota ) , whose fan base was staying away in droves as the paying public grew indifferent to the on-court product .
the timing of this move by team president and general manager ed stefanski was a head-scratcher .
" it 's not 100 percent on the coach , " a source with knowledge of the 76ers ' thinking said saturday afternoon .
" but at the same time , we did n't seem to have a plan . " .
stefanski named assistant general manager tony dileo coach for the rest of the season .
dileo has a good reputation as a coach , spending time over the last two decades on the sixers ' bench as an assistant and in europe as a head coach .
but unless circumstances change dramatically , jordan -- who became close with stefanski while both were in new jersey earlier this decade -- will be the odds-on favorite to get the job permanantly .
many league execs still think quite highly of jordan , and none of the players who matter in washington threw jordan under the bus after he was fired .
cheeks ' coaching moves have frequently been criticized over the years , both in philadelphia and in portland .
but he lost his job this time not only because of xs and os , but because so many of the 76ers ' players that blossomed under him last season , including center sam dalembert , forward andre iguodala and guard lou williams , struggled to get going this season .
and the moves cheeks made , like benching second-year forward thaddeus young and elevating guard willie green , have n't produced enough dividends .
" ed just was n't seeing any progress , " the source said , and stefanski expected more from a team that had signed free agent elton brand to an $ 82 million deal and re-signed core players iguodala and williams for $ 80 million and $ 25 million , respectively .
" we were n't progressing at the rate [ stefanski ] thought we should , and he thought it was time for a move , " the source said .
yet stefanski can not escape criticism , either .
bringing brand in was the signing coup of the nba offseason , to be sure .
but in doing that , stefanski changed the team 's footprint .
the sixers are still a very good transition team .
but when the game slows down , having to cater to brand leaves the lane clogged .
last season , iguodala , young and williams had driving room when philly ran its halfcourt sets , and dalembert showed occasional decent low-post play .
but now , brand is the man in the paint , forcing everyone else out on the perimeter .
left to fend for himself on the weakside , dalembert 's numbers have plummeted , and williams has just begun to play well .
brand is recovered from the achilles ' injury that kept him out of all but eight games last season with the clippers , but he 's been slowed by a bad hamstring , and his offensive numbers ( 15.9 points , a career-low .436 from the floor ) have been unspectactular .
no matter what the stats say , philly looks and plays slower this season .
and stefanski did n't get a big-time shooter who could stretch the court and take pressure off of brand inside .
veterans donyell marshall and kareem rush , signed later in the summer by philly , do n't strike much fear into opposing teams .
the result is philly 's 93.3 scoring average , 28th in the league ( only charlotte and oklahoma city have scored 100 points fewer times than philadelphia 's six ) , and .314 percentage behind the three-point line , 26th in the league .
" everybody zones them , " an eastern conference executive said saturday .
the sixers had just scored one of their more impressive victories eight days ago , rallying from a double-digit deficit in the second half to win on the road at detroit .
true , they had bad losses early to the bobcats and timberwolves , and lost a home-and-home to the cavaliers on wednesday and friday .
but last we checked , cleveland was 20-3 , owner of an 11-game win streak and the only remaining undefeated team at home this season .
the cavs are rolling , and losing to them is no embarassment .
another league source with knowledge of the team 's thinking said saturday that the cleveland losses played no role in cheeks 's firing .
cheeks received his second one-year contract extension in less than a year last september , taking him through the 2009-10 season .
while stefanski did n't hire cheeks ( that was former president billy king , whom stefanski replaced early last season ) , stefanski and cheeks had quickly established a solid , working relationship with one another .
cheeks quickly acquiesced last year when stefanski asked him to give more time to the team 's younger players , getting young and young vets rodney carney and williams bigger minutes .
the transition transformed the team , as the 76ers went on a 19-7 run last spring , turning opponents over and becoming deadly in transition .
they rode their hot streak into the playoffs , where they stretched detroit to six games before succumbing in the first round .
they were n't a finished product , though , and it was no secret that brand was stefanski 's target , just as he 'd been king 's ultimate target .
after a brief dalliance with atlanta free agent josh smith , so stefanski cleared as much cap room as possible , sending carney and center calvin booth to minnesota , and then struck , getting brand to spurn his former team , the clippers , as well as the warriors , for the sixers ' $ 80 million offer -- the " philly max , " as brand later called it .
after keeping iguodala and williams , all the heat was on cheeks .
saturday , he became the latest coach -- one-sixth of the league 's head men already gone in little more than five weeks -- to succumb to the pyre .
