2 polygamous leaders arrested in canada .
the leader of a polygamous communtity in western canada who has admitted having numerous wives and dozens of children was arrested wednesday and charged with practicing polygamy , according to court documents and local officials .
winston blackmore , long known as the bishop of bountiful , runs an independent sect of about 400 in bountiful , british columbia .
blackmore once ran the canadian arm of the utah-based fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints , but was ejected from the sect in 2003 by its leader , warren jeffs .
last june , british columbia attorney general wally oppal appointed a special prosecutor to look into allegations of criminal abuse at bountiful , despite two earlier legal opinions that said it would be difficult to proceed with criminal charges for polygamy itself .
blackmore openly admits to having numerous wives and dozens of children but has said the community abhors sexual abuse of children .
according to a court document filed in nearby creston , winston blackmore is facing a charge of practicing polygamy .
officials at the mormon hills school in the community , where blackmore is the superintendent , said he was arrested wednesday .
