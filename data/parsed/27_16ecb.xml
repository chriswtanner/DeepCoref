microsoft releases critical internet explorer patch .
the out-of-band security update fixes a javascript-related vulnerability that 's being actively exploited through hacked web sites .
microsoft ( nsdq : msft ) has released an out-of-band security update , ms08-078 , to fix a vulnerability in its internet explorer web browser that 's being actively exploited .
" at this time , we are aware only of attacks that attempt to use this vulnerability against windows internet explorer 7 , " said christopher budd , microsoft security response communications lead , in an e-mailed statement .
" our investigation of these attacks so far has verified that they are not successful against customers who have applied the security update .
ms08-078 has a maximum severity rating of critical for all versions of internet explorer . " .
on the heels of the yahoo deal that fell apart v 2 , comeback ceo jerry yang was skewered by the able hands of web 2.0 summit host john battelle .
paul martino , ceo of aggregate knowledge , talks about the company 's " online discovery " tool , which essentially looks across hundreds of millions of web sites and recommends content , products , and services to users in real time .
mashmaker allows developers to add a bit of javascript to any page and have that page automatically populated with appropriate widgets , making the page more useful for site visitors .
nonetheless , microsoft lists internet explorer 5.01 , 6 , and 7 as affected software in its security bulletin .
it also says separately , in the faq section , that internet explorer 8 beta 2 is affected .
the vulnerability can be exploited through javascript code posted on malicious web sites .
internet explorer users may be redirected to these sites through hacked legitimate sites .
if the malicious code is successful , it silently downloads malware onto the victim 's computer .
microsoft typically releases software patches , referred to as security bulletins , on the second tuesday of every month .
when critical vulnerabilities emerge and are actively exploited , microsoft often issues a patch as soon as it 's ready .
the last such out-of-band patch , microsoft security bulletin ms08-067 , was released on oct. 23 .
it addressed a vulnerability in windows server service that affected all currently supported versions of windows .
that vulnerability allowed an attacker to take over affected computers remotely .
when microsoft issued its out-of-band patch in october , it cited the vulnerability 's potential " wormability " -- meaning the hole could be exploited on a massive scale using self-copying malware -- as a reason for its action .
but ms08-078 is n't wormable .
" that shows that the wormability of a vulnerability is no longer a good indicator of the seriousness of a threat and that these web-based threats are now much more dangerous than network worms , " said roel schouwenberg , senior antivirus researcher for kaspersky lab , americas , in an e-mailed statement .
indeed , microsoft security researchers estimated that as many as 1 in 500 users of internet explorer could have been exposed to malware attempting to exploit the flaw .
" the browser flaw had been disclosed roughly one week ago as a zero-day vulnerability , and active exploits have been around the internet for that timeframe as well , " qualys cto wolfgang kandek said in an e-mailed statement .
" the workarounds provided by microsoft were very technical and quite cumbersome to implement , making it imperative for microsoft to release a fix as quickly as possible . " .
kandek suggests that microsoft is at a disadvantage in updating internet explorer because its browser does n't have a built-in update mechanism like other browser makers .
mozilla , for instance , just released firefox 3.05 to firefox users through its auto-update system .
microsoft is urging users of ie to test and deploy this update as soon as possible .
