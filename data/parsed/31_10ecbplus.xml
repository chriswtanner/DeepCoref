mcdermott fuels bluejays in valley tournament win .
doug mcdermott got a scoring record friday , will artino got a chance to showcase his skills on the big stage and gregory echenique got mad .
the first two factored heavily into creighton " s 65 - 53 victory against drake in the quarterfinals of the missouri valley conference tournament , but the last one might have been the deciding factor in moving the bluejays along to saturday " s semifinals .
echenique scored all 11 points of his points in the second half , grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked six shots .
six of his points , five of his rebounds and five of the blocks came after echenique got roughed up -- tackled , he said -- while cutting toward the basket midway through the second half .
no foul was called , but drake might have wished one had been .
after the no - call , the 6 - foot - 9 , 260 - pound echenique turned up the intensity to fuel a 15 - 2 run that turned a 47 - 44 creighton lead into a 16 - point cushion .
" it made me kind of mad when that happened , " echenique said .
" it changed my attitude a little , and gave me a little more of an edge .
i had to find a way to get that anger out , and i couldn " t say anything to the ref and risk getting a technical or something .
" i think i did the right thing , and it kind of capped my focus .
it made me play harder . " .
with echenique leading the late charge , creighton finally subdued a stubborn bulldog team that was playing to extend its season in an atmosphere that resembled a bluejays home game .
creighton fans filled almost two - thirds of the 9 , 000 seats in the lower bowl of the scottrade center , and experienced some anxious moments before their team finally took command .
mcdermott , artino and echenique figured heavily into the outcome that improved the bluejays to 25 - 7 and advanced them to a 1 : 35 p . m . semifinal meeting against indiana state , which defeated evansville 51 - 50 in friday " s second quarterfinal .
" will was great the first half and made some great plays in the second half , " creighton coach greg mcdermott said .
" doug was consistent offensively throughout , and i thought gregory really changed the game defensively in the second half .
" there was nothing that happened in the paint because of his energy and his ability to block some shots and change shots .
and he went and got the basketball off the boards . " .
doug mcdermott finished with 23 points , setting the school scoring record when he got his 11th point on a free throw with 4 : 43 left in the first half .
he made 8 of 14 shots from the field , including 3 of 4 3 - pointers , and grabbed seven rebounds .
artino , whose role has grown as his productivity has increased during the second half of the season , had a career - high 14 points and six rebounds .
five of his points came in a 7 - 0 run in the first half that turned a 12 - 12 tie into a lead creighton never relinquished .
still , things were getting tight when drake , which had defeated bradley in thursday " s play - in round , closed to 47 - 44 on seth vandeest " s basket with 10 : 03 to play .
on their next possession , the 15 - 17 bulldogs missed an open 3 - pointer that would have tied the game .
in between , echenique found himself sprawled on the court after getting bumped hard as he moved toward the basket on a pick - and - roll play .
he stayed down for several seconds , then glared at a referee as he got to his feet .
echenique turned into an aggressive force in the final 10 minutes .
" we are a totally different team , " greg mcdermott said when asked what a fired - up echenique means to his club .
" we don " t resemble the team that we are when he isn " t playing like that .
he is so active .
he made multiple plays on several possessions .
" i " m really proud of him , because sometimes it " s hard to get the switch flipped .
when it gets flipped , he " s hard to deal with . " .
echenique " s dunk and free throw after being fouled started creighton " s decisive run , putting the bluejays ahead 50 - 44 .
a vandeest layup would cut the bulldogs " deficit to four , but they wouldn " t score again for almost eight minutes while creighton stretched its lead to 62 - 46 .
" you have to know how to use it when you get mad , " echenique said .
" i think i used it the right way out there today . " .
his teammates know the bluejays are a different team when echenique is engaged , one reason doug mcdermott pulled him aside at halftime .
echenique had missed both of his shots in the first 20 minutes and , mcdermott said , appeared to be down on himself .
" i just told him , ‘ greg , you have to be the man here , "  " doug said .
" i told him he was going to be our guy and we were going to feed him the ball .
he took that to heart and played with a command .
" i " m proud of him , and hopefully he can continue to bring that night after night . " .
echenique scored five of creighton " s first eight points in the second half .
artino then had four in row as creighton opened its first 10 - point lead of the game before drake countered with a 9 - 2 spurt that got the bulldogs back with three points .
echenique " was definitely a big factor , " said vandeest , who had 13 points .
" he has a huge body and uses his body around the basket .
he really stepped up in the second half . " .
drake coach mark phelps agreed .
" look at his numbers , " phelps said .
" he had 11 and 11 , and had six blocks .
he was really good tonight . " .
artino was never better .
his 14 points bettered his career high of 13 .
he was two rebounds off his personal best , and his play , especially in the first half , gave creighton a huge boost .
" will was tremendous , " doug mcdermott said .
" he " s so easy to play with because he can see over the defense , he " s good at the high - low pass and he crashes the boards every time .
it " s great to have a guy like will on the team . " .
it goes without saying that it " s pretty valuable to have mcdermott around , too .
he came in needing 11 points to break rodney buford " s scoring record of 2 , 106 .
mcdermott had 10 points in the first 7 ½ minutes , then broke the record when he made the first of two free throws with 4 : 43 left in the half .
mcdermott now has 2 , 029 points in 106 games as a bluejay , but who " s counting ?
" it " s a special feeling that i can " t explain to pass guys like kyle korver , guys i looked up to in my childhood , " he said .
" and to do it in front of a big crowd here in st . louis is cool .
" but i don " t even think about that stuff .
you guys are going to make the most of it , but i " m just out there trying to win and play hard every night . " .
