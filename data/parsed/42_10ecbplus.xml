more details on the blackberry q10's release in the us are starting to surface .
t - mobile confirmed in an email that its business customers will have the opportunity to register for the device starting next week on april 29th , with availability and pricing details to follow "at a later date . " .
general consumers will likely have to wait a little longer , if t - mobile follows the same launch strategy that it did with the z10 .
of course , registration doesn't actually equate to pre - orders or actually purchasing the phone yet - - all we've heard from official channels is that it'll be coming towards the end of may - - but it's still a solid confirmation that qwerty fans will at least be able to get their bb10 on in the very near future .
