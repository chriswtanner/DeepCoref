mob boss vincent "the chin" gigante , the powerful mafioso who avoided jail for decades by wandering the streets in a ratty bathrobe and slippers , feigning mental illness , died monday in prison .
he was 77 .
the head of the genovese crime family , who had suffered from heart disease , died at the federal prison in springfield , mo . , said prison spokesman al quintero .
it was the same place where rival mob boss john gotti died of cancer in 2002 at age 61 .
gigante's death also was confirmed by christine monaco , a spokeswoman for the fbi , the organization that worked for years to put him behind bars .
dubbed the "oddfather" for his bizarre behavior , gigante had scored a lengthy string of victories over prosecutors , but it ended with a july 1997 racketeering conviction .
he was sentenced to 12 years in prison .
after a quarter - century of public craziness , he finally admitted his insanity ruse at an april 2003 federal hearing in which he calmly pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice .
that brought him another three - year sentence .
. . .
for the man described by the new york times magazine as "the last great mafioso of the century , " his admission was the final act in a 50 - year career linking the era of old - time gangsters and the modern - day mafia of gotti .
