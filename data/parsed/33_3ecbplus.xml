jurors on thursday watched video capturing the horrific moment a mother was gunned down in broad daylight while picking up her 11 - year - old daughter outside a new york city school .
behind her another mother was seen shot in her arm before staggering against a wall while trying to hide her own son from the alleged gang members' stray gunfire from a nearby rooftop .
this frightening surveillance video was presented at the brooklyn supreme court on thursday during the trial of two men accused in killing zurana horton , 34 , a mother of 12 , in 2011 and wounding two others , including an 11 - year - old girl .
prosecutors say andrew lopez , 20 , an alleged 8 block gang member fired the shots meant for rival gang members from the howard projects while his brother jonathan carrasquillo , 24 , gave the orders .
'when me and my son were on the floor , i noticed mrs horton fall down .
i honestly thought she was shot in the head .
there was blood , ' said unique armstead , who was shot along with an 11 - year - old girl nearby according to the new york post .
mrs armstead says that just before the shots were fired she passed a group of young men arguing on the street about a gun .
her testimony matched prosecutors' claims .
feeling uneasy , she says 'i speed - walked to my son , and i held him .
i was scared .
i was trying to get out of harm's way . ' .
she took her son into a nearby store to wait it out .
when the fight appeared to die down , she says she slipped back onto the street with her son by her side when a stray bullet shot straight into her arm .
she next saw horton fall down dead .
mrs horton is seen sprawled out on the sidewalk beside a pool of blood on the surveillance video .
witnesses are seen cowering in fear around her .
'at the time , i thought it was a brick , but it was a bullet , ' mrs armstead said of her injury .
lopez , who was 18 at the time of the shooting , confessed to being the rooftop sniper according to initial reports by the new york daily news .
the gunman said the shooting near public school 298 in brownsville had stemmed from a turf war between two brooklyn gangs .
lopez told police that 'he did not mean to shoot the ladies , ' the source said .
a second witness had expected to testify in the shooting on thursday as well but after threatened with death by the brother of the alleged gunman , their testimony has been delayed until monday .
'the man is an emotional wreck , ' brooklyn supreme court judge vincent del giudice said , according to the post .
lopez has been linked to a brooklyn gang known as '8 block , ' who police say are engaged in a turf battle with the neighboring young guns gang .
nypd commissioner raymond kelly said : 'we're certainly pleased with the fact that the investigation has identified mr . lopez and he's made statements and apparently made a full confession , ' the daily news reported .
lopez told police he was aiming for rival gang members when a stray bullet hit the mother of 13 who was collecting her children from school .
horton was planning to marry her boyfriend on valentine's day in 2012 .
also arrested were lopez' half - brother , 17 - year - old kristian , and carrasquillo .
all three live in a fifth - floor apartment inside 1800 pitkin ave . , the same building from where the gunman opened fire , police said .
that apartment building is said to be where 8 block got their name , the post reported in 2011 .
carrasquillo was charged with murder , and kristian lopez was arrested for possession of a baseball bat , police said .
andrew lopez had a previous arrest for walking down pitkin ave . brandishing a loaded gun three years ago , sources told the daily news .
the shooting frenzy in which at least 12 shots were fired began just 13 minutes after school finished .
cheanne mcknight , 11 , is recovering from a graze wound to her cheek , while a 31 - year - old brooklyn mom was shot in the arm .
police recovered 12 9 - mm shell casings on the roof of the pitkin avenue apartment and the sidewalk .
