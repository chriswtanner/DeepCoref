tyler hansbrough scored 20 thursday night to break north carolina 's career scoring record and help the no. 1 tar heels remain unbeaten with a 91-73 victory over evansville in chapel hill , n.c .
the reigning national player of the year finished 7-for-14 from the field and had nine rebounds for north carolina ( 10-0 ) , which shook off a slow start and stretched the lead to double figures shortly after hansbrough passed phil ford for the record midway through the first half .
ford , now an assistant coach to larry brown with the nba 's charlotte bobcats , finished his career in 1978 with 2,290 points .
