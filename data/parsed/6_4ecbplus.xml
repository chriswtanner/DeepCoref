gary ross back in talks to direct 'the hunger games' sequel 'catching fire' .
april 9 , 2012 .
despite reports last week that said gary ross would definitely not be returning to direct the hunger games sequel , catching fire , it seems he will be back at the negotiating table with lionsgate this week .
the hollywood reporter says ross is set to meet with lionsgate officials on monday to resume negotiations .
according to thr , two major sticking points are salary ( ross apparently wants a raise ) and schedule , with the hunger games set to begin filming in august .
that's in part to accomodate jennifer lawrence's january start date for filming the x - men : first class sequel , a project that legally and contractually holds priority for the actress over catching fire .
lionsgate is also under pressure to meet a previously announced november 2013 release date for catching fire .
the majority of fans were outspoken last week in their disappointment that ross would not return for catching fire .
some launched the "gary ross is boss" campaign to show support , a petition has been circulating twitter , and it will be the top discussion subject on monday night's episode of the hg fireside chat podcast .
what do you think about ross returning ( or possibly not ) for catching fire ?
