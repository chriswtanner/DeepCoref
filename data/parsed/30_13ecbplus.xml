subsea cable operator , seacom , announced on twitter today ( 20 october 2011 ) that they have restored services to all customers using alternate routes , following an outage that was initially expected to take 12 days to repair .
in a statement published on its official website , seacom said that a repair vessel is now in transit .
"the vessel has received the master permit for this repair ; operational permits are being finalized and should be received prior to arrival on the repair ground , " seacom said .
the repair is now expected to be completed in late october , but seacom warned that "the usual exogenous factors associated with sub - sea repairs , including weather and currents , may further impact the repair . " .
seacom started to experience problems on saturday , 8 october 2011 , which it said was caused by a problem on a cable between abu talat in egypt and marseilles in france .
last week friday ( 14 october 2011 ) , seacom announced that it had restored services to its business customers , which included internet service providers , via alternate routes .
