striking yet another blow at the very heart of piracy in the gulf of aden , indian warship ins mysore and its marine commandos thwarted a hijack attempt on an ethiopian merchant vessel on saturday and captured 23 pirates and a large arms cache in the operation .
the arrest of the 23 pirates ( 12 somali and 11 yemeni ) and the arms haul is the largest such seizure in the ongoing anti-piracy operations off somalia .
the confiscated arms and equipment included seven ak-47s , three other assault rifles , 13 loaded magazines , a rocket-propelled grenade launcher with two rockets , several grenades , a gps set and a mobile phone .
early november , the british royal navy had captured eight pirates , who were subsequently handed over to kenya to face trial in the port town of mombasa .
" the external affairs ministry is now working to find out to which country the 23 pirates in ins mysore 's custody can be handed over , " said a senior officer .
" ins mysore , which replaced stealth frigate ins tabar early december , may head for djibouti on the horn of africa .
our plan to base a maritime reconnaissance aircraft like a dornier at djibouti ( which has a french military base ) is also underway , " he added .
pirates operating with sheer impunity from ports like eyl and hobyo in somalia , torn apart by an 18-year-old civil war , have already attacked as many as 100 merchant vessels transiting through the crucial shipping lane this year .
at least 17 of the hijacked ships and their crew are still being held captive by the pirates for ransom .
the dramatic action on the high seas on saturday began at 11am ist when the 6,900-tonne delhi-class missile destroyer ins mysore received a " distress call " over the mmb channel 16 from ethiopian merchant vessel gibe that it was being attacked by a pirate " mother dhow " and a speedboat around 150 nautical miles east of aden .
an armed chetak helicopter , with four marine commandos , was immediately " launched " from ins mysore towards gibe , which was 13 nautical miles from the indian warship at that point in time .
" the sailors on gibe were exchanging small arms fire with the pirates .
on spotting the armed chetak hovering overhead , the pirate boats broke off their attack , " said an officer .
soon after , steaming at full speed , the deadly ins mysore also reached the spot .
by then , all 23 pirates had clambered onto the 10-metre-long dhow -- later identified as 'salahaddin ' -- in a bid to escape .
ins mysore then opened fire across the dhow 's bows with its heavy-calibre machine guns , forcing the sea bandits to come to a complete halt .
a detachment of heavily-armed marine commandos promptly sped across to the pirate dhow in their fibre-glass inflatable boats .
" seeing the marcos , the pirates surrendered quite easily , even though for some time they pretended to be plain fishermen .
a search of the dhow led to the discovery of the large arms cache and three outboard motors , " he said .
" the grenades , being unstable , were thrown off overboard .
the 23 pirates and the other arms were taken on board ins mysore , which will resume its patrolling duties after handing over them over to appropriate ashore authorities , " he added .
though over 20 warships from us , eu and other countries are patrolling the piracy-infested gulf of aden , which connects the red sea to the indian ocean , it 's actually the indian navy which has taken the battle to the pirates .
on november 11 , ins tabar had repulsed two hijack attempts , one on an indian ship ( mv jag arnav ) and the other on a saudi oil carrier ( ncc tihama ) , one after the other .
then , on november 18 , it had sunk thai trawler " ekawat nava 5 " , which had been commandeered by pirates , after a gunbattle .
though the navy had come in for some criticism for sinking the thai trawler , admiral sureesh mehta had declared that his force had done nothing wrong .
" thai ownership does not change the situation .
it was under the command of pirates .
use of force was inevitable ... .
we acted in self-defence , " said the navy chief .
external affairs minister pranab mukherjee , too , had strongly defended the navy 's anti-piracy action on the high seas .
