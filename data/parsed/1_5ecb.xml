well it 's better late than never , tara .
the original trainwreck tara reid 's publicist confirmed that the actress reid was admitted into promises treatment center in los angeles , california .
" we appreciate your respect to her and her family 's privacy at this time , " the actress 's rep jack ketsoyan tells people magazine .
reid checked herself in on tuesday , december 9 , 2008 .
her rep , however , declined to reveal reid 's reason for this seemingly abrupt decision .
reid 's , 33 , acting abilities had always been overshadowed by her 'party girl ' reputation , and certainly set the bar for young starlets like lindsay lohan and paris hilton .
in an october interview with people , reid claimed she was a 'social drinker ' and that her crazy past was far behind her .
'i 've done it .
trust me .
i 've done enough for a lifetime ofeverything .
i 've had a great time .
i partied .
i had fun .
i ate and drank whatever .
i dated a million guys , but i 'm so happy with where i 'm at right now .
i do n't need to do anything anymore , ' she told the magazine .
apparently , old habits die hard .
hopefully , promises will help her get back on track .
