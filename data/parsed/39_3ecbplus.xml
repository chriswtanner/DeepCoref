monday 5 august 2013 08 . 33 bst .
peter capaldi , best known for playing foul - mouthed spin doctor malcolm tucker in political satire the thick of it , has been named as the 12th actor to play the doctor in the tv series doctor who .
the 55 - year old glasgow - born actor , a self - confessed lifelong doctor who fan , is the oldest actor to play the time lord since the first doctor , william hartnell , in 1963 .
he will replace matt smith , the youngest ever doctor at 26 when he was introduced in 2009 .
the new doctor was announced in a special live broadcast on bbc1 on sunday night .
capaldi had been firmly installed as the bookies' favourite ahead of contenders including luther's idris elba , ben whishaw and daniel rigby , despite a cloak of secrecy surrounding the identity of the new doctor .
internally the bbc referred to the selection process as project houdini , with reportedly only 10 people knowing capaldi had been chosen .
"it is so wonderful not to keep this secret any more , " he said .
"for a while i couldn't even tell my daughter .
being asked to play the doctor is an amazing privilege .
like the doctor himself i find myself in a state of utter terror and delight .
i can't wait to get started . " .
capaldi admitted that it would be tricky to throw off the spectre of his most famous on screen persona , the wily and unscrupulous spin doctor malcolm tucker for the hit bbc show .
"i think malcolm has been banished from the mirror by the new doctor who wouldn't put up with malcolm's attitude to the world , " said capaldi in an interview with zoe ball .
capaldi , who described himself as a "full anorak" doctor who fan who once wrote a letter aged 15 about doctor who to the radio times , admitted he was yet to get his head around being named as one of british tv's most enduring and best loved characters .
"he's not me yet , " he said .
"but he is reaching out and hopefully we will get it together .
even though i am a lifelong doctor who fan i've not played him since i was nine .
i downloaded old scripts and practised those in front of the mirror . " .
capaldi is not completely new to doctor who , having appeared in the programme playing caecilius in the episode "the fires of pompeii" in 2008 with david tennant .
steven moffat , lead writer and executive producer of doctor who , said : "it's an incendiary combination : one of the most talented actors of his generation is about to play the best part on television . " he said .
" peter capaldi is in the tardis . " .
capaldi said he had his phone on silent when he received the call that he had got the role - he was in prague shooting a bbc remake of the three musketeers , where he plays cardinal richelieu .
an assistant delivered the good news by saying : "hello doctor" .
moffat said capaldi had been thought of before but that the timing had not been right .
"we all had an idea , we all had the same idea , it was quite a different idea , " he said .
"we got the notional 12th doctor around to my house and made a home video .
"everyone said 'yes' that is the doctor .
there comes a right time for the right person to play it .
that moment has arrived . " .
the live announcement was broadcast simultaneously on bbc america , highlighting the increasing popularity of the franchise internationally and growing importance of the world's biggest tv market for the bbc franchise .
in doctor who lore capaldi is the 12th doctor , leaving just one left and raising the long - held question of how the script writers will overcome the problem to keep the franchise going .
"we're getting towards the end of the incarnation cycle and everyone always remembers that bit of the overall plot , " said tom spilsbury , editor of the official doctor who magazine .
"the question is probably a few years away now for doctor who fans , i don't think they will be worried about it just yet .
doctor who is popular so [ the bbc ] will invent away to get around it when the time comes , won't they ? " .
the hope of a first female doctor has once again been dashed , though moffat tantalisingly hinted that the prospect remained for the future .
"time lords can change gender , so it is not against the rules , " he said .
jenna coleman , who will remain as the doctor's companion when capaldi takes over the role next year , said : "with steven's writing and his talent i know we'll be making an amazing show with an incredible incarnation of number 12 .
i can't wait to start this new adventure . " .
the decision was welcomed by smith who pre - recorded a message to capaldi , saying : "i just want to wish my successor all the best and just say good luck and good on you for getting it , because i know he is both a huge fan of the show and a really nice guy .
"the casting of it made me really excited genuinely , and as a fan i think it's a really canny choice , so good luck mate , it's going to be a thrill . " .
smith added : "if i had to pick someone , i'd pick him , because i think he's great .
and weirdly enough , after the 11th hour , he came up to me in the street and said , 'ah mate , well done .
i watched your episode last night , it was brilliant , i think you're really good' .
and i really needed that , i needed a sort of boost and i never forgot it . " .
capaldi has appeared in more than 40 films and tv shows , including dangerous liaisons , shooting fish , minder , the vicar of dibley , peep show and waking the dead , since being cast as danny oldsen in the 1983 film local hero .
he is also playing guardian editor alan rusbridger in the forthcoming film about the wikileaks affair .
