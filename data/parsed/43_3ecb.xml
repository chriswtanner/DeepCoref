ati a potent weapon for amd in clash with intel .
the pitched battle for supremacy in the chip-making market reached a critical phase yesterday with advanced micro devices ( amd ) in sunnyvale , calif . announcing its decision to acquire canadian graphic cards manufacturer ati technologies ( ati ) .
the imminent purchase of ati , analysts say , is the most vital element in amd 's concerted campaign to dethrone the mighty intel corp .
amd agreed to buy markham , ont-based ati for around $ 5.4 billion in cash and stock , the companies announced monday .
the acquisition , which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , would turn amd into one of the world 's largest providers of graphics chips .
" you wo n't see it tomorrow , but the merger will potentially put amd on a more equal footing with intel , " said michelle warren , an analyst with evans research in toronto .
another canadian analyst noted that the merger was likely to bring significant benefits to both companies .
amd would round out its graphics processing unit portfolio , said eddie chan , lead analyst , mobile and personal computing at research firm idc canada in toronto. ati , he said , also blends in well amd 's live ! convergence platform .
" ati has a strong product portfolio that covers components for such offerings as mobile phones , wireless products , digital tv , and high definition tv . " .
on the flip side , amd allows ati to hitch a ride on the integrated chip bandwagon .
discrete graphics components have been suffering over the years as the market moves on to integrated chips such as those sold by intel , said chan .
" a tie-up with amd allows ati to move towards integrated solutions or the so-called system-on-a-chip platform . " .
the marketing message from ati executives too is all about the 'mutual benefits ' of the proposed acquisition .
adrian hartog , senior vice-president for consumer products at ati , characterized the alliance as a growth opportunity for both companies .
it is generally expected that the merged company will harness ati 's strong r and d track record .
in a list released late last year of canada 's top 10 r and d spenders , ati technologies was in position 5 .
the company spent $ 389.1 million in r and d in 2004 , an increase of 18.3 percent .
the list was released by toronto consulting firm research infosource .
the ati research team has a proven capacity to turn major new products out every 12 to 18 months .
" bringing these two companies together will allow us to transcend what we have accomplished as individual businesses , " said hector ruiz , chairman and chief executive officer ( ceo ) of amd in a statement .
" all of our product lines will benefit . " .
earlier , amd revealed plans to build a highly efficient dual-core notebook processor , set for release in the second half of 2007 .
amd enjoys considerable strength in the server and consumer computing industry while ati is considered a leader in the computer gaming arena .
warren said recent years have seen these disparate markets move closer to each other .
for instance , ati 's shader model 3.0 , which allows more complex shading and more realistic image rendering , is finding traction in the enterprise space with companies that are heavy computer-aided drafting ( cad ) users , including customers in the automotive , aerospace and animation spaces .
hartog said the purchase of ati by amd will involve ' some changes ' but he downplayed any potential lay-offs from among the company 's more than 3,000 employees .
" ontario has one of our largest r and d teams and that arrangement will continue .
we are not anticipating any immediate lay-offs , " hartog said .
any acquisition raises the issue of employment stability , said warren , but amd would be wise to allow ati to continue operating as it does .
" there is a strong chance ati will be given a measure of autonomy because it has great strength in its area . " .
warren said the alliance also " steps up " ati 's competition with rival nvidia of santa clara , calif. apart from ati , amd also turns to nvidia for graphics components .
" depending on the contract , it is possible that nvidia 's access to amd chips will be limited , " said warren .
if that happens , evans research analyst michelle warren said , " it will open the doors for nvidia to search for new options and possibly talk with intel .
however , hartog said there will be no move to constrain nvidia 's supply .
" nvidia will continue to be amd 's partner .
both ati and amd are committed to open platform systems , " he said .
" in fact that is what differentiates us to our partners and customers . " .
