a strong earthquake struck indonesia's aceh province on tuesday , killing at least one person and leaving two others missing .
many houses were damaged and dozens of villagers were injured .
the magnitude - 6 . 1 quake struck at a depth of just 10 kilometers ( six miles ) and its epicenter was located 55 kilometers ( 34 miles ) west of the town of bireun on the western tip of sumatra island , the us geological survey said .
the worst - hit area was the district of bener meriah , where the quake caused a landslide that killed a man and left his wife and a young boy missing , said fauzi , an official of the local disaster agency .
"dozens of people were injured and are being treated at three hospitals , " said fauzi , who like many indonesians uses a single name .
he said at least 22 houses were badly damaged in the district .
at least five people were reportedly injured and 10 houses were damaged in takengon , the capital of central aceh district , said sutopo purwo nugroho of the national disaster mitigation agency .
"i see many houses were damaged and their roofs fell onto some people , " said bensu elianita , a 22 - year - old resident in bukit sama village in central aceh district .
"many people were injured , but it is difficult to evacuate them due to traffic jams . " .
she said people in the village ran out from their houses in panic and screamed for help .
at least two homes were totally flattened , she said , adding that the quake also caused a blackout in the village .
the quake also caused panic among officials attending a meeting of the asia pacific economic cooperation in medan , the capital of neighboring north sumatra province .
the officials were escorted from the second - floor meeting room by security officers .
indonesia is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the pacific ring of fire , an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the pacific ocean .
in 2004 , a huge earthquake off aceh triggered a tsunami that killed 230 , 000 people across asia .
