jul 13 , 2009 11 : 23am .
president obama will name dr . regina benjamin as u . s . surgeon general in a rose garden announcement late this morning .
benjamin , an alabama family physician , runs a rural health clinic in bayou la batre .
she was the first african - american woman to head a state medical society and received a macarthur foundation "genius grant" last year .
she became known nationally for her determination to rebuild her clinic , destroyed in hurricane katrina in 2005 .
in her profile on the national institutes of health web site , benjamin writes about her calling to become a doctor while in medical school at the university of alabama at birmingham .
"i believe it was divine intervention - it was in medical school when i realized there was nothing else i'd rather do with my life than to be a doctor .
i had never seen a black doctor before i went to college , so i did not have an idea that i wanted to be one .
i never thought i that i couldn't , but i never really thought about it at all . " .
according to a 1997 article in ebony , benjamin said she applied to yale university school of law before she attended college .
"they sent me a reply politely telling me that i needed my undergraduate degree first . " .
to pay for college , she turned to the national health service corps , which gave her a tuition reimbursement in exchange for committing to work in areas where there was a shortage of doctors .
that agreement took her to bayou la batre where she was the only doctor for 2 , 500 people , most of whom lived below the poverty line and spoke no english .
benjamin was named the person of the week on abc news' world news tonight in 1995 and conveyed the challenges of servicing poor patients .
"the people are real , genuine , hardworking .
they're proud people .
they make a living the best they can on shrimp boats .
they , unfortunately , are too poor to pay their medical bills at times , " she told abc news' peter jennings .
"sometimes it's very frustrating .
sometimes i can do everything that the textbooks taught me and school taught me and then patients can't buy their medicine .
and it's all for nothing . " .
in january , it was reported that president obama had asked cnn's dr . sanjay gupta to be surgeon general , and that gupta had mulled the offer for a while , but eventually turned it down .
benjamin will appear in the rose garden today as the president makes the nomination formal .
