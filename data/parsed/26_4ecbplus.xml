us mafia godfather gigante dies .
one of the most famous mafia godfathers in the us , vincent "the chin" gigante , who spent much of his life avoiding prison , has died in jail , aged 77 .
he was , according to the new york times , the last great mafioso of the 20th century .
for years , gigante evaded prison by concocting an elaborate mental illness .
he routinely wandered the streets of new york's manhattan , shuffling along in slippers and a tattered bathrobe , muttering incoherently .
this bizarre behaviour earned him the title "the oddfather" , but also helped to keep him out of jail , as a series of juries were convinced that gigante was indeed insane .
but in 1997 , he was finally convicted of racketeering , and in april 2003 he admitted to a court that his behaviour had been a ruse to stay out of prison .
heart disease .
he died in a medical prison in springfield , missouri , on monday morning , said a spokesman for the facility .
the cause of his death was unknown , although he had had heart disease , the spokesman said .
his death was confirmed by the fbi , whose agents worked for decades to bring him to justice .
he was born in the bronx in 1928 to italian immigrants , and given the nickname "chin" - short for vincenzo .
the ex - boxer became part of the powerful genovese mafia family , eventually winning the patronage of ambitious mobster vito genovese .
gigante carried out an attempted hit on the boss of the family , frank costello , in 1957 .
the frightened costello refused to name his attacker in court , and left genovese to take over the mob .
mumbling quietly .
when the fbi closed in on gigante , he feigned mental illness to escape conviction for police - bribery in 1970 .
from then on , his act became more elaborate .
federal agents once found him standing naked in a shower , holding an umbrella .
relatives - even including his brother , a roman catholic priest - insisted he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia , dementia and alzheimer's disease .
at his trial in 1997 , for conspiracy to murder other organised crime figures , racketeering , and extortion , he sat in a wheelchair , mumbling quietly , apparently unaware of what was going on .
it took the testimony of six turncoat mobsters , and fbi tape recordings in which the so - called oddfather was heard conversing in a perfectly normal way , to convince the jury of his guilt .
he was jailed for 12 years , but it took until 2003 for the chin to admit his sham .
