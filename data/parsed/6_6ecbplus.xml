gary ross has not departed "the hunger games . " .
according to thr , ross will resume negotiating with lionsgate about returning for the "games" sequel "catching fire" at some point on monday .
it has been quite a three days for ross .
on friday , indiewire's blog the playlist exclusively reported that the director had stepped away from negotiations with lionsgate , not because of any monetary strife , but because ross wanted to do something different for his next film .
that was countered by deadline . com's nikki finke and mike fleming , who wrote on saturday that ross hadn't stepped away , and that lionsgate wanted him to return but for a reasonable price .
ross was reportedly paid $3 million to write and direct "the hunger games . " .
he'll also earn five percent of the backend grosses , a significant number since "games" has already accumulated $459 million around the globe .
per thr , the negotiations between the two parties are "delicate , " but a deal could get done soon .
after all , "catching fire" begins shooting in august with a script from oscar winner simon beaufoy ( "slumdog millionaire" ) .
