a michigan man shot to death one person and injured two others monday at the suburban detroit accounting firm from which he was fired last week , police said .
the suspect , 38 - year - old anthony lacalamita , was "deliberately seeking out these individuals , " according to troy police lt . gerry scherlinck .
a female receptionist died and two men , believed to be "management level employees , " underwent surgery for gunshot wounds at royal oak beaumont hospital , scherlinck said .
a 50 - year - old man from dexter , michigan , tipped off authorities to lacalamita's location after hearing a description of the suspect's vehicle - - a 2007 silver ford fusion - - on the radio .
the man , who did not want to be identified , called 911 when he realized the vehicle directly next to him matched the description on the radio , according to genesee county sheriff robert pickell .
police attempted to stop the vehicle as it entered vienna township , but lacalamita would not pull over , pickell said .
lacalamita drove across several counties , at speeds up to 120 miles per hour , surrendering only after authorities boxed in his car on interstate 75 in saginaw , michigan .
he surrendered "peacefully and without incident , " pickell said .
upon arrest , police seized a shotgun and several shells , he said .
lacalamita is being held in the genesee county jail and is expected to be handed over to the detroit police .
a web site for the public accounting firm gordon advisors in the building lists lacalamita as an employee .
"we heard gunshots . . . .
we're on the third floor , barricaded in , " bill adgate , who works for lpl financial in the office building , told cnn affiliate wdiv - tv as the search went on for the gunman .
