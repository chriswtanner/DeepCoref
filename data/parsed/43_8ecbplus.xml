amd acquires seamicro -- big bet on architectural shift for servers .
summary : rich fichera looks at the risks and potential rewards of amd's recent acquisition of innovative server startup seamicro .
march 1 , 2012 - - 07 : 58 gmt ( 23 : 58 pst ) .
at its recent financial analyst day , amd indicated that intended to differentiate itself by creating products that were advantaged in niche markets , with specific mention , among other segments , of servers , and to generally shake up the trench warfare that has had it on the losing side of its lifelong battle with intel ( my interpretation , not amd management " s words ) .
today , at least for the server side of the business they made a move that can potentially offer them visibility and differentiation by acquiring innovative server startup seamicro .
seamicro has attracted our attention since its appearance ( blog post 1 , blog post 2 ) , with its innovative architecture that dramatically reduces power and improves density by sharing components like i / o adapters , disks and even bios over a proprietary fabric .
the irony here is that seamicro came to market with a tight alignment with intel , who at one pint even introduced a special dual - core packaging of their atom cpu to allow seamicro improve its density and power efficiency .
most recently seamicro and intel announced a new model which featured xeon cpus to address the more mainstream segments that were not a for seamicro " s original atom - based offering .
so what does amd hope to gain from this acquisition ?
the strategic goal is a differentiated server architecture into which they can insert amd silicon and ip .
the seamicro architecture shares many of the characteristics of the calxeda / hp redstone architecture , and can potentially allow amd to produce reference architecture for its system partners to leverage that gives them significant density advantages over any conventional x86 server offering .
since this architecture is initially targeted at dense computing environments such as those found in web 2 . 0 , cloud service providers and similar workloads , as well as potentially at conventional hpc , the prospects for amd are interesting .
long - term success will hinge on several interlocking factors .
1 . how much will amd focus this offering on the ultra - dense space that seamicro started addressing versus trying to also take a bite out of the enterprise space ?
2 . how aggressively will they scale it ?
the seamicro fabric does not extend beyond the single enclosure boundary , but that appears to be an implementation decision , not a fundamental architectural issue .
my personal belief is that fabric - based servers are the wave of the future , with seamicro calxeda / hp serving as very significant guidelines for future development .
scaling the fabric first for management and then for actual data traffic for shared i / o and eventually for coherent memory operations if needed is a natural progression .
3 . what other ip will amd add ?
amd has an interesting portfolio of gpu technology as well as cpu , and the incorporation of gpu technology could provide further differentiation in niche markets .
amd has a choice of ways to monetize this ip , from selling systems based on its own processors ( possibly as early as late this year ) to providing reference designs and / or licensing the architecture or selling components like the fabric asics .
4 . will they also support arm processors ?
if amd becomes the source of licensed ip for vendors wanting to chase hp in ultra - dense servers , they can also make money by licensing their technology and selling components for non - x86 architectures .
5 . what will intel do ?
at least one of intel " s partners , hp , already has a fabric - based dense server design that can support x86 .
will intel develop a similar reference architecture in the hopes that their major systems partners will adopt it ?
all in all , many ways this could play out , but a bold move and one that may serve to trigger a rapid change in the types of servers available to users over the next 24 months .
