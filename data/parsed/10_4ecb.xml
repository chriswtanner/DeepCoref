the angels have offered an eight-year contract to mark teixeira , general manager tony reagins said friday night .
the contract would be the longest and richest in club history .
the value could almost double the previous club record , the $ 90 million guaranteed last year to torii hunter .
reagins declined to provide the value of teixeira 's offer .
the angels are believed to have offered at least $ 160 million , matching or exceeding the highest offer so far reported for teixeira .
owner arte moreno flew from his arizona home to las vegas on tuesday and met personally with scott boras , the agent for teixeira .
angels spokesman tim mead said he believed moreno presented the offer to boras at that time .
mead also said he did not know when the offer might expire .
none of the other teams in the teixeira sweepstakes -- the boston red sox , baltimore orioles and washington nationals -- has been reported to have offered more than eight years .
the nationals reportedly have bid $ 160 million over eight years , the orioles between $ 140 million and $ 150 million over seven years .
the details of the boston bid have not been reported .
the angels had exclusive negotiating rights with teixeira for the first 15 days after the world series , but they declined to make an offer during that time and said they would do so at an appropriate time .
boras has had one month since then to solicit bids from other teams , enabling him to let moreno know how the market had developed and enabling moreno to make his first -- and perhaps only -- offer without boras shopping that offer to other teams .
the angels have not wavered from treating teixeira as their top priority , even as other coveted options have evaporated .
the angels negotiated with pitcher cc sabathia , a favorite among their scouts , but they chose not to make an offer after deciding they would not match the new york yankees ' initial $ 140-million bid .
sabathia agreed to a seven-year , $ 161-million deal with the yankees late tuesday night , hours after moreno met with boras .
on friday , outfielder raul ibanez signed a three-year , $ 31.5-million contract with the philadelphia phillies .
the angels had considered signing ibanez if they lost out on teixeira , with ibanez playing left field and kendry morales replacing teixeira at first base .
the angels ' eight-year offer first was reported friday night on the team-owned radio station , am 830 .
