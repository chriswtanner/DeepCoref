pricing and release dates are still tbd , but by signing up for alerts on t - mobile's website you will be one of the first to know .
if blackberry's release of the z10 to business customers first is any sign , we may very well see the same approach when it comes to releasing the q10 , meaning that normal consumers may have to wait a little longer for their chance to purchase one of the devices .
although release details are still absent , this e - mail assures us that t - mobile will in fact be carrying the q10 in the future .
the q10 has been previously rumored to be released sometime in may , which seems reasonable given the timing of t - mobile's announcement today , as well as blackberry's announcement of the device making its way to canada on may 1st .
