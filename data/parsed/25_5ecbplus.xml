pierre thomas placed on injured reserve by new orleans saints .
jan 5 , 2011 .
pierre thomas was placed on injured reserve by the new orleans saints on wednesday , meaning he won't play in the 2011 nfl playoffs .
losing thomas is bad enough , but it is compiled with the fact that they just lost chris ivory on tuesday .
this means they will be missing two of their best players in the rushing game , and it could weaken the attack that the saints have on offense even further .
coach sean payton announced it himself on wednesday , revealing through the new orleans saints twitter account that thomas had been placed on ir .
it was a very shocking revelation in the roster moves the saints have been making and any saints fan that came into the postseason extremely confident about their team should be a tad worried about what the saints can do now .
they still have reggie bush and julius jones to head the running game , so at least the saints weren't left empty handed .
last season it was thomas that led the saints in rushing , posting 793 total yards in 14 games .
he had been hobbled this year , and that was the main reason that ivory ended up seeing so much playing time .
ivory rushed for 716 yards this year , leading the saints in rushing , and giving them a great option as they tried to survive without thomas and bush behind quarterback drew brees on offense .
we reported tuesday how ivory is done for the year , and it raises the chances of seattle pulling off an upset on saturday .
the seattle vs . new orleans game will be the first one on wild card weekend , with kickoff scheduled for 1 : 30 p . m . pst .
seattle is the big underdog in this game , even though it is the team hosting the game .
getting to play in front of the home crowd and going up against a banged - up saints team could be exactly what the seahawks need to pull an upset , but they will need quarterback matt hasselbeck to come up huge as well .
hasselbeck had more than 300 passing yards against the saints back in week 11 , so maybe seattle has a chance after all .
as for the saints on offense , they still have super bowl mvp drew brees taking the snaps .
he is having a bit of a down year by his standards , especially in the category of interceptions , but this is still a guy who could throw for 400 yards on any given night .
a lot will be asked of him on saturday , but he has been in pressure - packed games quite a few times at this point in his career .
