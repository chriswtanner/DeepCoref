ny mob don vincent 'chin' gigante dies in prison .
december 19 , 2005 .
convicted mobster vincent "chin" gigante , famed for wandering the streets of new york in a tattered bathrobe in a show of insanity , died on monday in federal prison , officials said .
considered one of the last of new york's old - time mafia dons , the reputed head of the genovese family was serving a 12 - year sentence at the u . s . medical center for federal prisoners in springfield , missouri .
he was 77 .
gigante was also nicknamed "the oddfather" and "the pajama king" - references to his habit of shuffling along the sidewalk in manhattan's greenwich village muttering to himself , looking disheveled and unshaven in a robe and slippers .
his attorneys argued that gigante was mentally ill and incapable of running a crime family ; prosecutors argued he was feigning illness to avoid prosecution .
eventually , a jury found gigante guilty in 1997 of conspiracy to murder other organized crime figures , racketeering , extortion and other charges .
the case relied heavily on the testimony of six former mobsters who became government informants , including salvatore "sammy the bull" gravano , whose testimony was critical in the 1992 conviction of the late mobster john gotti .
following gigante's conviction , prosecutors said he continued to run the crime family from prison .
in 2003 , he pleaded guilty to obstructing justice by misleading doctors about his mental state .
the cause of death was unknown , but gigante had been suffering from heart disease , said prison spokesman al quintero .
