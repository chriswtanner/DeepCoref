a 57 - year - old wasilla woman has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges she defrauded the state of alaska and lied to the u . s . department of agriculture during the operation of the now - defunct matanuska creamery .
the indictment also charges valley dairy ceo and investor karen b . olson with concealing the alleged criminal conduct of the former dairy manager , kyle beus .
a grand jury in december indicted beus on charges he misused federal grant money , and he awaits trial .
the charges against olson allege she fraudulently obtained a $430 , 000 state agriculture department loan to keep the valley dairy afloat by concealing its finances .
the indictment also said she submitted false documents to convince the usda in 2008 to waive its prohibition on using dairy and ice cream - making equipment at valley dairy as collateral on state loans .
the equipment was purchased in 2007 using federal grants that didn " t allow the equipment to be sold or encumbered without special authorization from the usda .
alaska dispatch has more here .
by the mid - 1980s , mat maid was faltering , and a state - run corporation took over management .
it struggled until sarah palin became alaska's governor .
she arrived on the scene shortly before the state board of agriculture and conservation , which had watched the dairy bleed cash for years , voted to deny it further loans .
with that move threatening to kill the dairy , palin fired the board and appointed another , which voted to give the dairy more money .
that went on until the new board realized , as did the old board , the dairy just couldn't compete in the real world of modern - day alaska with cheaper milk shipped in from the lower 48 .
enter beus , then a valley dairy farmer , and bob havemeister , another dairy farmer .
they formed a joint venture to take over the equipment and operations of mat maid in an effort to keep it alive .
beus was the one who eventually ended up with most of the equipment and set up a company called klondike creamery and candy , which briefly marketed ice cream in alaska .
it was not long , however , before it was rolled into valley dairy - - a joint effort of beus , robert wells and olson .
olson was the former alaska state executive director of the u . s . department of agriculture farm service agency , a job she held from 1993 to 2001 .
olson has insisted in a number of interviews with alaska dispatch that the only interest she ever had was trying to keep the dairy business alive in alaska .
after she joined beus at valley dairy , the company began efforts to tap a $5 - million pool of usda money set aside for rural development .
beus was indicted last year on charges he took at least $120 , 000 of that money for his own "personal and discretionary use . " .
where and when olson learned of his alleged activities is not explained in the indictment against her , but it says she devised a scheme "to conceal the true nature of the valley dairy finances and the fraudulent activity of beus , and to obtain a loan from the arlf ( alaska revolving loan fund ) to keep the valley dairy , of which olson was an investor and employee , operating . " .
as many of you undoubtedly know there was a rather suspicious fire that burned the old matanuska maid creamery to the ground .
( i know , right ? ) .
if you are new to this particular palin scandal there is no better place to catch up then over at andrew halcro's now defunct blog .
now some are suggesting that this might finally be the straw that snaps the back of palin's uncanny ability to avoid incarceration .
however i would not count my eggs too quickly , because while it seems that olsen has every reason to reduce her sentence by ratting out her old boss , palin has somehow slipped through the grasping fingers of the feds a few times before .
so let's stay tuned and see how this plays itself out .
