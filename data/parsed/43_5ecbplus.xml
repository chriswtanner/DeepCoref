amd buys seamicro , enters server hardware business .
feb 29 , 2012 2 : 31 pm .
advanced micro devices announced wednesday it is buying low - power server vendor seamicro , a surprise move that puts amd in the systems business and disrupts intel by acquiring one of its close partners .
amd will pay us$334 million in cash and stock for seamicro , an 80 - employee silicon valley startup that has gained attention for building highly dense and power - efficient servers for use in large - scale cloud computing environments .
seamicro ceo andrew feldman will become general manager of a new division at amd , the data center server solutions group .
amd plans to sell seamicro - branded servers directly to customers , but it bought the company primarily for its technology , which it hopes to license to other server vendors to build their own low - power systems , amd officials said .
"seamicro has a proven technology that has been benchmarked in key customer sites to show improvements in power consumption and total cost of ownership .
that [ intellectual property ] was very attractive to us , " said lisa su , senior vice president and general manager for amd's products division .
the move will be seen as a setback to intel , which had built a tight partnership with seamicro .
all the servers seamicro currently sells are based on low - power intel atom processors , and just a few weeks ago the companies held a joint press conference where intel sang seamicro's praises .
an intel spokesman declined to comment on the acquisition wednesday before it was officially announced .
amd will continue to sell seamicro servers based on intel processors "for the foreseeable future , " lu said .
by the end of this year , she said , it will release the first seamicro servers based on amd opteron processors .
feldman wouldn't say when seamicro and amd began talks but said the deal came about "unbelievably quickly . " .
he said there were other suitors for the company , including non - chip vendors .
seamicro developed an interconnect technology that allows it to eliminate all but three of the chips on a standard server motherboard .
that allowed it to develop servers that it claims consume one quarter the power and one sixth the space of standard x86 servers .
its products are geared primarily towards high volume , web - based transaction workloads that don't require the computing muscle of a traditional xeon or opteron server processor .
mozilla uses seamicro servers , for instance , to deliver software updates to users .
it's not clear which amd processor seamicro will use as an alternative to intel's atom chip , though amd has several low - power offerings and plans to release a new , low - power chip for tablets , code named hondo , later this year .
however , seamicro has said its technology can also benefit servers based on more powerful processors .
a server based on an opteron chip would be efficient for running mysql and mondodb database workloads , feldman said , as well as php applications used by many online services .
it could also be used to build efficient supercomputers , he said .
it's a new direction for amd , one it hopes will allow it to expand its server business and capitalize on the fast - growing cloud computing market .
spending on servers for such "scale out data centers" is expected to grow 33 percent a year on average for the next several years , amd said , faster than the server market as a whole .
the move puts amd in the difficult position of competing with some of its customers , though lu insisted that will not be a problem .
the scale of seamicro's business today is much smaller than that of a hewlett - packard or a dell , she said , and amd thinks the value of seamicro's technology to server vendors will outweigh their competitive concerns .
amd's server business could use a lift , noted dean mccarron , principal analyst at mercury research .
"they are obviously experiencing a decline and this would be a way to expand the market for their processors , " he said .
amd is paying $281 million in cash for seamicro and the remainder in stock , lu said .
it expects to close the deal in march .
