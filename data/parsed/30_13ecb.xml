as if the middle east and south asia do n't have enough problems with war , terrorism and poverty , now communications in many of the nations in those regions have been disrupted .
the cause - three international underwater cables in the mediterranean sea that were damaged friday .
millions of people trying to make phone calls or log on to the internet wo n't be doing so for a while .
a similar problem happened nearly a year ago , but this one has the potential to be worse .
the damage this time broke all three of the cables connecting europe with asia via the middle east .
many carriers in the middle east and south asia will have to route their european traffic around the globe , instead of via a more direct route .
no word yet on an official cause of the damage .
previous reasons for cable breaks include oil drilling and wayward anchors .
