commandos from an indian warship today caught pirates in the act in the gulf of aden and took 23 of them into custody , a spokesperson at naval headquarters said .
indian naval ship mysore , a destroyer , picked up a distress call from merchant vessel gibe , which flies an ethiopian flag , when it was 13 nautical miles ( about 24km ) from the cargo ship .
details of what exactly happened are still awaited .
the gibe was about 150 nautical miles ( about 277km ) from aden when the pirates , said to be in a dhow or fishing vessel named salaluddin , fired at it and tried to board it , according to information available now .
two speedboats suspected to be carrying more pirates were approaching the gibe .
the navy spokesperson said marine commandos from the mysore flew in the destroyer 's embarked helicopter , boarded the salaluddin and caught 12 somalis and 11 yemenis .
they also confiscated seven ak-47s , a 5.56mm and a 7.62mm rifles , a grenade launcher , three outboard motors ( used to power dinghies or inflatable rafts ) , a handheld global positioning system and mobile phones .
the pirates in the speedboats fled .
the mysore is tasked to patrol a 480-nautical-mile corridor from bab-el-mandab in the west to the mouth of the gulf of aden .
it is required to be in touch with merchant vessels within a 15-nautical-mile radius at all times .
last month , marine commandos from ins tabar were reported to have rescued two cargo vessels that were being attacked .
later , the tabar fired at and sank a thai trawler that the indian navy said was a pirate " mother vessel " .
the mysore will eventually replace the tabar in patrolling the gulf of aden and off the coast of somalia .
a much larger ship than the frigate , the mysore was deployed because it is capable of staying out at sea longer without having to replenish frequently .
