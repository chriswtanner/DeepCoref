south sudan warns of war after sudan bombs refugee camp .
military aircraft from sudan crossed the new international border with south sudan and dropped bombs thursday in and around a camp filled with refugees , officials said .
a government official initially reported deaths , but an american activist who spoke to aid workers at the camp later said there were no casualties .
the violence in and near the yida refugee camp , located 10 miles south of the border , came one day after bombings were reported in another region of south sudan , an attack that provoked strong condemnation from the u . s . state department .
the president of south sudan , which became the world's newest country only four months ago , said he fears the khartoum - based government intends to invade the south soon .
"whatever allegations khartoum labels against the republic of south sudan are baseless , but intended to justify his pending invasion of the south , " president salva kiir said .
he later added : "we are committed to peaceful resolutions to any conflict but we will never allow our sovereignty to be violated by anybody . " .
there was no immediate comment from the sudanese government in khartoum on thursday .
the violence is especially troubling given the history between the two sides : the black african tribes of south sudan and the mainly arab north battled two civil wars over more than five decades , and some 2 million died in the latest war , from 1983 - 2005 .
a peace deal ended the war and south sudan became its own country in july after a successful independence referendum .
but there have been lingering disputes over border demarcation and oil - sharing revenues .
ryan boyette , a former aid worker who lives in sudan who is now leading a team of 15 citizen journalists , said he talked to five aid workers in the yida camp , all of whom said that four bombs were dropped but that they caused no casualties .
