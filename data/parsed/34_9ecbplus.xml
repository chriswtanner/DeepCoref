obama nominates rural catholic doctor as surgeon general .
washington d . c . , jul 13 , 2009 / 02 : 00 pm ( cna ) .
president barack obama has announced that he is nominating a rural alabama catholic doctor to be the u . s . surgeon general .
reacting to the news , the rector of mobile's catholic cathedral , where she serves as lector , is encouraging her to defend the unborn in her new position .
in a monday statement president obama said he intended to nominate dr . regina benjamin as surgeon general , the united states government's "chief health educator . " .
the president's announcement focused on health care reform as an urgent challenge .
dr . benjamin , the first black woman to be admitted to the american medical association , founded the bayou la batre rural health clinic in alabama in 1990 .
there , she served the poor alabama community on the gulf coast after 1998's hurricane georges and 2005's hurricane katrina .
she had to rebuild the clinic after it burned down , receiving a $500 , 000 macarthur foundation "genius grant" in 2008 for the effort .
dr . benjamin is known as being a national leader in improving health disparities , motivated by the need in her community .
immigrants from vietnam , cambodia and laos make up a third of the area's population of 2 , 500 .
she received the nelson mandela award for health and human rights in 1998 .
pope benedict xvi awarded her the pro ecclessia et pontifice medal in 2006 .
president obama's announcement also noted that dr . benjamin received the 2000 national caring award which was inspired by mother teresa .
the nominee graduated from xavier university in new orleans , a catholic school descended from the educational work of st . katharine drexel .
dr . benjamin received her medical degree from the university of alabama , birmingham .
dr . benjamin has also served on the board of trustees for the catholic health association , a position that she will resign from to take on her new job .
in a monday statement , cha president and chief executive officer sister carol keehan , dc , said that the organization "rejoices for our nation" in dr . benjamin's nomination .
"in dr . benjamin , we have a brilliant physician who understands health care , nationally and internationally ; but even more important , she knows the health care needs of the people of bayou la batre , alabama , who she meets on a daily basis . " .
sr . keehan said the nominee will "enrich the nation" with her competence and integrity and she praised dr . benjamin's daily experience working in "a very vulnerable committee . " .
cna spoke with msgr . michael l . farmer , vicar general of the archdiocese of mobile and rector at the cathedral of the immaculate conception in mobile .
msgr . farmer said dr . benjamin is a "delightful lady" who has served as lector at the cathedral and has been "readily available" to speak with various catholic organizations .
she has also worked with catholic charities in mobile and has spoken on the good the organization does .
he reported that she grew up at the historically african - american parish shrine of the holy cross in the gulf coast town of daphne , alabama .
the monsignor also confirmed that then - archbishop of mobile oscar lipscomb recommended dr . regina benjamin for the pro ecclesia et pontifice award .
the medal is bestowed to lay people and clergy who have given zealous and outstanding service to the church .
the honor was instituted by pope leo xiii in 1888 .
"he recommended her for her example in her catholic faith as well as in her medical profession , " msgr . farmer said , noting the "amazing amount of work" she has done for the common good and for health care in south mobile county .
expressing certainty that dr . benjamin had opportunities to go elsewhere , he said the doctor had made a "concrete decision" to remain in alabama and address her patients' needs .
"she's noted not only for clinic work , but for going on site to these people's homes .
and they're not necessarily the nicest places to go to . " .
he said it was "remarkable" and "bridge - building" that dr . benjamin , an african - american woman , has done her work in the bayou , which he described as a majority white community with "a lot of poor people in it . " .
given the appointments and policy decisions of the obama administration that favor the promotion of abortion , cna asked msgr . farmer if he knew what dr . benjamin's position is on abortion .
he explained that he did not "explicitly" know dr . benjamin's position on abortion and other life issues and had never discussed it with her .
"i would hope that her position would be in line with the church's position , " he told cna .
"as far as i know she has been in conformity with the catholic church . " .
"i would hope that that would continue , " he added , noting that it could be "difficult" to adhere to catholic moral teaching in a position with the obama administration .
in a monday morning telephone interview with cna , sr . keehan pointed out that dr . benjamin isn't "in a specialty that would do abortion" and that her work to provide health care to the poor and elderly demonstrates her "tremendous attention to the issue of life . " .
"and you've got her own archbishop who asked the holy father to give her the pro ecclesia medal .
"you don't get that for just being a token catholic , " she told cna .
in december 2008 a coalition of several dozen pro - abortion groups released a strategy document titled "advancing reproductive rights and health in a new administration" calling on obama to improve access to "abortion care . " .
the document named the surgeon general's office as a "position of interest . " .
