microsoft releases fix for 'zero - day' ie browser bug .
microsoft has released a temporary patch to fix a "zero - day" , or previously unknown , vulnerability in its internet explorer ( ie ) web browser .
the software giant said the bug , which relates to the browser's memory , could affect all versions of ie6 to 10 .
attackers could set up websites specifically designed to exploit the vulnerability , microsoft said , and then run malicious code on users' computers .
targeted attacks directed at ie8 and 9 had already been reported , it said .
"this is a serious vulnerability potentially affecting millions of windows computers , " dana tamir , director at security company trusteer , told the bbc .
"hackers are already exploiting this so i hope microsoft produces a full patch within a few days , " she said .
in a blog post , microsoft's dustin childs advised concerned users to set internet and local security zone settings to "high" to block activex controls and active scripting .
he also recommended changing ie settings to prompt users before running active scripting .
but doing this "may affect usability" , he said , so users should add sites they trust , and visit often , to the ie trusted sites zone .
microsoft's fix it patch applies only to 32 - bit versions of ie .
it is not being rolled out automatically and is not intended to be a replacement for scheduled security updates , the company said .
"this temporary workaround is like applying a band - aid to a wound , " said ms tamir .
last week , microsoft admitted that it had been forced to rewrite four of its security updates just three days after they had been issued .
customers had reported receiving repeated demands to install the updates even after they had already done so .
