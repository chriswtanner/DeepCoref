brussels condemns israeli bombing of un school .
pressure to obtain a ceasefire in gaza has been mounting , with the eu warning israel it was " destroying " its image , while israeli forces on tuesday ( 6 january ) killed at least 40 people during an attack on a united nations-run school in gaza .
the israeli attack on the fakhora school in the northern town of jabaliya , which also wounded around 100 people , was the deadliest single strike of the offensive so far and the third un school to come under fire within 24 hours .
the bombing has drawn international condemnation , with the eu calling it " completely unacceptable . " .
" we think the attack is completely unacceptable and strongly condemn the fact that civilians were hit while sheltering themselves from the violence , " said cristina gallach , spokesperson of eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
john ging , the head of the un relief and works agency , through which most eu aid to gaza is distributed alongside the red cross and red crescent condemned the attack as " horrific " and suggested israel knew it was targetting a un facility .
" we have provided the gps co-ordinates of every single one of our locations , " he told the bbc .
" they are clearly marked with un insignia , flags flying , lights shining on the flags at night .
it 's very clear that these are united nations installations . " .
the israeli military however argued hamas fighters had fired mortar shells at their forces from the school and they had to return fire .
in the aftermath of the school attack , tel aviv decided to allow the establishment of a " humanitarian corridor " into the gaza strip , premier ehud olmert 's office said last night .
christopher gunness , spokesman for the un relief and works agency ( unrwa ) described the situation on the ground to the euobserver .
some 1 million gazans are currently without electricity , another 250,000 are without running water , and every hospital is running on emergency generators .
unrwa hands out food to 750,000 people daily , but mr gunness warned that they will run out of food " in days , rather than weeks " , and there was no food distribution on tuesday at all .
tzipi livni , the israeli foreign minister said several times last week that there is no humanitarian crisis in the occupied territory , and the israeli ambassador to the eu yesterday told this website that ms livni had explained to the eu peace delegation on monday .
" everything is being done and will be done to avoid a humanitarian crisis . " .
the un 's mr gunness disagreed with the minister .
" there is a humanitarian crisis already , so she 's not managed to avoid one . " .
" it 's impossible to do our jobs. the reason we had to cancel food distribution today is because our trucking contractor had two relatives killed by the israelis .
there was a wake organised but then that was attacked too .
it 's just too dangerous for them to be driving around . " .
" during the period of relative calm of about five-six months following the 19 july truce , we regularly asked to get aid in , but israel did n't give permission . " .
on 19 june 2008 , a six-month egypt-brokered truce agreement was reached between hamas and israel .
tel aviv however broke the cease-fire on 4 november 2008 , when israeli troops raided the gaza strip and killed six hamas gunmen .
at the time , israel claimed hamas was planning to use a tunnel to capture israeli soldiers .
the truce completely broke down on 20 december , when hamas officially announced that they would not be extending the cease-fire , and began launching rockets targetting southern israel once again .
meanwhile , egypt has put forward a truce plan that would include an immediate ceasefire , as well as meetings in cairo between leaders of israel and " palestinian factions , " news wires report .
details of the proposal are not known yet , but its main focus is to halt the violence and secure borders between gaza and israel , as well as gaza and egypt - so as to limit arms smuggling from egypt into the gaza strip .
according to the bbc , both palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and the us have backed the proposal .
israel has said it would look into the suggestion .
" i am very sure it will be considered ... we take it very , very seriously , " gabriela shalev , israel 's ambassador to the un , was quoted as saying by reuters .
more than 600 palestinians have been killed so far in the 12 days of the israeli offensive into gaza , and around 3,000 have been wounded .
palestinian health ministry officials say at least 195 of the victims are children .
israel has so far lost seven soldiers and four civilians in the conflict .
the eu has also warned israel that the offensive was tarnishing its image , german news agency dpa reports .
" we have come to israel in order to advance the initiative for a humanitarian ceasefire and i will tell you , mr president , that you have a serious problem with international advocacy , and that israel 's image is being destroyed , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told israeli president shimon peres during the visit of an eu delegation in the region .
but mr peres retorted that israel was fighting other wars and a public image one was not among them .
" europe must open its eyes .
we are not in the business of public relations or improving our image .
we are fighting against terror , and we have every right to defend our citizens , " he told an eu ministerial delegation , afp reports .
