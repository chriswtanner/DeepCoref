a series of powerful earthquakes rocked manokwari , the capital of west papua , on sunday , killing four people , injuring dozens and destroying hundreds of buildings .
one 7.3-magnitude tremor was felt as far away as australia and sent small tsunamis into japan 's southeastern coast , the associated press reported .
the first quake , magnitude 7.6 , struck at 4:43 a.m. local time about 135 kilometers from manokwari at a depth of 35 kilometers , the u.s. geological survey said .
dozens of aftershocks followed .
at least four people died in papua , where the runway of the airport nearest the epicenter was split by the force , president susilo bambang yudhoyono told reporters .
" i 've instructed emergency steps be taken to help our brothers and to restore power and other vital utilities , " yudhoyono said .
among the dead was a 10-year-old girl , identified as yolanda mandofi , whose head was crushed , said local hospital director hengky tewu .
" our ambulances are picking up two more , " he said .
another 19 patients at the hospital were treated for broken bones , cuts , crush wounds and other injuries .
papua police chief maj. gen. bagus ekodanto said he had received reports that a hotel and a rice warehouse had been " destroyed " , but he did not know if anyone had been killed in the incidences .
a search for victims was under way .
several stories of the mutiara hotel in the main city manokwari collapsed , said ina , a nurse at a navy hospital , adding that she had already treated 20 quake victims .
the quakes also reportedly damaged the kalidingin hotel .
electricity was cut off to the coastal city of population 167,000 , where people fled their homes in the dark fearing a tsunami , said hasim rumatiga , a local health official .
the quakes forced thousands of people to take refuge , including in military fields in the city , said manokwari military commander col. inf. irham waroiham .
about 1,000 residents had taken shelter in a military field , 500 in a navy field , 500 in the yard of the manokwari regent office and 7,000 others in masni district , which lies just outside of manokwari city .
the meteorology and geophysics agency had issued a tsunami alert , but it was revoked within an hour after it was determined the epicenter of the main quake had been within the mainland .
quakes centered well within the mainland do not pose the threat of a tsunami to indonesia , but can still spread large waves to neighboring countries , such as japan .
japan 's meteorological agency said tsunamis 10 to 40 centimeters in height swept into towns along the coast .
the quakes were also felt in sorong regency .
the regency police spokesman snr. comr. agus rianto told the jakarta post the quakes had damaged 18 houses , injuring 11 residents .
the latest quakes in manokwari occurred on oct. 10 , 2002 , the largest recorded at magnitude 7.6 , killing three people .
another strong quake hit in 1996 , triggering enormous waves that hammered into the north coastal area of papua , as well as sorong , biak and manokwari .
