b.c. attorney general confirms charges laid against top two polygamist leaders .
two top leaders of the controversial polygamous sect in bountiful , b.c. , have been arrested and charged with practising polygamy .
b.c. attorney general wally oppal confirmed that winston blackmore and james oler were arrested wednesday .
oppal said blackmore is alleged to be married to 20 women , while oler is accused of committing polygamy by being married to two women .
" this has been a very complex issue , " he told the canadian press .
" it 's been with us for well over 20 years .
the problem has always been the defence of religion has always been raised . " .
oppal said some legal experts have believed that a charge for practising polygamy would n't withstand a charter of rights challenge over the issue of freedom of religion .
" i 've always disagreed with that , " he said .
" i 've always taken the position that 's a valid offence in law .
and if someone says that it 's contrary to their religion let a judge make that decision . " .
he said he 's pleased a prosecution will proceed , providing some clarity to whether the law will be upheld by the courts .
oppal said in 2005 , when he was appointed attorney general , that he was concerned about the polygamy issue in bountiful " because of the exploitation of women and children . " .
the community had come under investigation in the past but oppal said he asked rcmp to reopen the investigation shortly after he was elected .
sgt. tim shields told reporters that creston rcmp began an investigation into allegations of polygamy and sexual exploitation in the fall of 2005 .
that investigation was completed in september 2006 and recommendation was made to crown for charges to be laid .
a follow-up investigation began last september and the two men were arrested this morning and taken to the rcmp detachment in cranbrook , b.c. , shields said .
the men were expected to appear in court wednesday afternoon .
last june , oppal appointed a special prosecutor to look into allegations of criminal abuse at bountiful , saying renewed public concerns compelled him to act .
that came despite two earlier legal opinions that it would be difficult to proceed with polygamy charges .
officials at the mormon hills school in bountiful , where blackmore is the superintendent , said he was arrested wednesday .
about 800 people live in the community in southeastern b.c. , where members of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints practice multiple marriage .
the sect is a breakaway offshoot of the mormon church , which renounced polygamy more than a century ago .
blackmore , who is the leader of one of two groups within the community , openly admits to having numerous wives and dozens of children but has said the community abhors sexual abuse of children .
however , blackmore has refused in previous interviews to discuss allegations that teenaged girls in the community marry older men or that others are sent to polygamous groups in the united states .
oler is the leader of the other group in the community , which has long been divided .
the issue of polygamy in british columbia came up again last year after more than 450 children were apprehended by child-welfare authorities from a sister polygamous community in texas .
at least one of the girls in that case was from bountiful , refocusing the spotlight on a community that has existed in relative obscurity in b.c. 's kootenays , not far from the u.s. border .
and polygamist leader warren jeffs , the sect 's prophet in the u.s. , is behind bars south of the border .
he was convicted in utah as an accomplice to rape and faces trial in arizona on other charges related to the marriages of members of sect there .
after the special prosecutor was announced , blackmore accused oppal of religious persecution .
" it can not possibly be about polygamy , " blackmore wrote in an email to the canadian press last june .
" it must be about his own religious bias and now he wants the liberal government to persecute some of the citizens that they have an obligation to serve and protect . " .
blackmore has said he has tried to meet with oppal in the past , but that the attorney general has refused .
