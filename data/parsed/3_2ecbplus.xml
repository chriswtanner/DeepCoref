nov . 30 , 2009 .
a convicted child molester who was supposedly confined to a wheelchair overpowered two prison guards today , handcuffed them , stole their weapons and walked off wearing one of their uniforms .
arcade joseph comeaux jr . , 49 , is serving a life sentence for several charges -- including indecency with a child -- and was en route from the estelle unit in huntsville , texas , to the stiles unit in beaumont , texas , when he escaped just after 9 a . m .
lyons said that comeaux used a wheelchair in prison -- he "claimed it was necessary for his mobility" -- and added , "since he fled on foot , that's obviously in question . " .
described as a 6 - feet tall and weighing approximately 200 pounds , lyons warned that comeaux knows the area where he escaped well and could have family nearby .
he initially was imprisoned on february 1979 on three 10 - year sentences for rape of a child , aggravated rape of a child , and burglary of a building with the intent to commit theft .
his supervision was revoked and he returned to prison in may 1984 with a new charge of indecency with a child , given a new 20 year sentence .
between 1991 and 1998 , comeaux was in and out of prison on parole violations until he finally returned to prison in june 1999 to serve a life sentence for aggravated sexual assault .
in 1999 , comeaux stabbed his wife during a visit , using his wheelchair to pin her against a wall while he stabbed her .
his wife survived , but another inmate who tried to break up the attack also suffered stab wounds , and comeaux was convicted of additional assault charges and received two additional life sentences .
