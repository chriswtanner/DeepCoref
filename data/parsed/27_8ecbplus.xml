microsoft rushes out security patch for internet explorer .
17 september 2013 - 21 : 29 .
normally , microsoft releases security bulletins for software products on the second tuesday of each month .
that happened last week as scheduled , but today the company announced it has rushed out an additional patch designed to fix an exploit that has been found in internet explorer , and is being used in attacks on ie8 and ie9 .
in a post on its security response blog , microsoft says the issue would allow a hacker to launch a remote code execution if a person surfs to a website using ie that contains malicious code .
the blog adds , "there are only reports of a limited number of targeted attacks specifically directed at internet explorer 8 and 9 , although the issue could potentially affect all supported versions . " .
the company has released a "fix - it" patch , "cve - 2013 - 3893 mshtml shim workaround" to plug this security hole in all currently supported versions of ie .
in addition , microsoft recommends that users set their security settings on the web browser to "high" to block any activex controls and active scripting on websites .
it also recommends users set up ie so that it informs them ahead of time before running any active scripting features .
the company plans to release a full security patch that will be a more complete solution to this problem in the near future .
