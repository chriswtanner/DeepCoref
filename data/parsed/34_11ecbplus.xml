regina benjamin u . s . surgeon general nominee .
july 13 , 2009 .
president barack obama held a press conference , july 13 , 2009 to announce his nominee for u . s . surgeon general , regina benjamin .
here is the transcript of the announcement .
president barack obama : before i introduce america's next surgeon general , i'd like to say a few words about our ongoing efforts to reform the health care system that she will help oversee .
we are now closer to the goal of health care reform than we have ever been .
over the last several weeks , key committees in the house and the senate have made important and unprecedented progress on a plan that will lower costs , provide better care for patients and curb the worst practices of the insurance companies .
it's a plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade .
let me repeat that : it is a plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade and eventually will help lower our deficit by slowing the skyrocketing costs of medicare and medicaid .
now , even though we are close , i've got no illusions that it's going to be easy to get over the finish line .
there are going to be more debates and more disagreements before all is said and done .
but health care reform must be done .
i know there are those who believe we should wait to solve this problem or take a more incremental approach or simply do nothing .
but this is the kind of criticism we heard when the country tried to pass medicare , a program that is now providing quality care to generations of american seniors .
it's the kind of criticism we heard when we tried to pass the children's health insurance program , which has provided quality care and coverage to millions of kids .
it's the same washington thinking that has ignored big challenges and put off tough decisions for decades .
and it is precisely that kind of small thinking that has led us into the current predicament .
so , make no mistake : the status quo on health care is no longer an option for the united states of america .
if we step back from this challenge right now , we will leave our children a legacy of debt , a future of crushing costs that bankrupt our families , our businesses and , because we will have done nothing to bring down the costs of medicare and medicaid , will crush our government .
premiums will continue to skyrocket , placing what amounts to another tax on american families struggling to pay bills .
the insurance companies and special interests that have killed reform in the past will only continue to benefit even more , and they'll continue to deny coverage to americans with pre - existing medical conditions .
people will continue to lose health insurance just because they lose their job or they change jobs .
this is a future that we cannot afford .
this country can't afford to have health care premiums rise three times faster than people's wages as they did over the last decade .
we can't afford 14 , 000 americans losing their health care every single day .
we can't afford a future where our government will eventually spend more on medicare and medicaid than what we spend on everything else .
during the campaign i promised health care reform that would control costs , expand coverage and ensure choice , and i promised that americans making $250 , 000 a year or less would not pay more in taxes .
these are promises that we're keeping as reform moves forward .
this is no longer a problem we can wait to fix .
this is about who we are as a country .
health care reform is about every family's health , but it's also about the health of the economy .
so , i just want to put everybody on notice , because there was a lot of chatter during the week that i was gone : we are going to get this done .
inaction is not an option .
and for those naysayers and cynics who think that this is not going to happen , don't bet against us .
we are going to make this thing happen because the american people desperately need it .
and even those who are satisfied with their health care right now , they understand that if premiums keep on doubling and if employers keep on shedding health insurance because it's unsustainable , and if you look at the trajectory of where medicare and medicaid are going , then inaction will create the biggest crisis of all .
and so i understand people are a little nervous and a little scared about making change .
you know , the muscles in this town to bring about big changes are a little atrophied , but we're whipping folks back into shape .
we are going to get this done .
and if there's anyone who understands the urgency of meeting this challenge in a personal and powerful way , it is the woman who will become our nation's next surgeon general , dr . regina benjamin .
the list of qualifications that make dr . benjamin an outstanding candidate to be america's leading spokesperson on issues of public health are long indeed .
she was in the second class at morehouse school of medicine and went on to earn an m . d . from the university of alabama at birmingham and an mba from tulane .
she served as associate dean for rural health at the university of south alabama college of medicine , and in 1995 , she became the first physician under 40 and the first african - american woman to be named to the american medical association's board of trustees .
in 2002 , she became president of alabama's state medical association , and she has received numerous awards and recognitions , including the macarthur genius award .
it's very impressive .
but of all these achievements and experience , none has been more pertinent to today's challenges or closer to regina's heart than the rural health clinic that she has built and rebuilt in bayou la batre .
did i say that right ?
