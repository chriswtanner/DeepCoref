undersea internet cables severed near egyptian coast line .
have you experienced any internet connection or mobile phone problems yesterday ! ?
it seems that another incident of an undersea telecommunications cable being severed on tuesday has resulted in partially blocking internet and mobile services in alexandria and some other governorates .
in a statement to al - masry al - youm news paper , mahmoud al - goweiny , a member of the national telecommunications regulatory authority's board of directors said that the cable cut happened around the same time that a different cable , owned by telecom egypt , was also cut , affecting services in egypt .
he also iterated that this particular undersea cable has frequently malfunctioned since late 2007 .
this cable is most likely to be the sea - me - we 4 that passes through egypt coming from europe and then reaches asia .
despite the after effects of this cable cut seems to be limited , however these incidents have been occurring more than once in a relatively short period of time .
severing a main internet pipe - line could leave a country's communication and economy crippled for at least 72 to 120 hours causing a lot of problems !
it should be time to re - think protecting these valuable communication life lines !
etisalat egypt and linkdotnet are one of egypt's largest internet service providers , and among the most affected by the cable cut .
no further details were reported by authorities about the effects of the cable cuts .
