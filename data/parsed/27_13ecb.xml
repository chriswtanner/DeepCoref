microsoft issues emergency patch to curb password-stealing hackers .
microsoft today issued an emergency update to plug a critical security hole present in all versions of its internet explorer web browser , a flaw that hackers have been leveraging to steal data from millions of windows users .
the patch , which microsoft dubbed ms08-078 , fixes a security vulnerability that microsoft says already has been used to attack more than 2 million windows users .
as security fix and other members of the tech community have chronicled , attackers have been busy compromising thousands of web sites by seeding them with code that installs password-stealing software on computer systems of web site visitors who use internet explorer .
microsoft estimated monday that one in every 500 windows users had been exposed to sites that try to exploit the flaw .
additionally , it said the number of victims was increasing at a rate of 50 percent daily .
vulnerability management company ncircle said microsoft 's decision to issue the patch outside of its normal patch tuesday ( second tuesday of each month ) cycle is wise , given the current exploitation of the flaw and because instructions for exploiting the flaw are now available online .
" given the ongoing attacks for this bug and because the technical details have been available to the public for over a week , this is clearly a high risk client side vulnerability that everyone should patch now , " said andrew storms , director of security for ncircle .
this is an urgent update .
if you use windows , apply this patch now .
windows users can download the fix at windows update , or by enabling automatic updates .
