sources : sox may not be out of teixeira chase .
team execs meet with player's agent .
updated 3 : 09 am est dec 19 , 2008 .
despite saying they have been outbid for free agent first baseman mark teixeira , the red sox do not believe they are completely out of the chase , sportscenter 5 has learned .
sources have also told sportscenter 5's mike lynch more about the negotiations that took place thursday at teixeira's texas home .
lynch reported the red sox team of owner john henry , coo larry lucchino and general manager theo epstein offered teixeira , 28 , an eight - year deal worth $184 million or $23 million per season .
it was then that agent scott boras countered by asking for an eight - year contract worth $200 million , sources said .
lynch reported that henry became infuriated at that point , balking at the massive sum .
in an e - mail to media members thursday night , henry said , "we met with mr . teixeira and were very much impressed with him .
after hearing about his other offers , however , it seems clear that we are not going to be a factor . " .
henry's reference to the "other offers" leaves open the possibility that he is calling boras' bluff , who has been known to inflate the value of offers and the number of suitors pursuing his client , lynch reported .
boras represented former red sox center fielder johnny damon , who signed with the new york yankees in 2005 after the boston brass apparently refused to believe that the offer from their archrivals was real .
lynch also learned that one of teixeira's hometown teams , the washington nationals , has made a huge offer .
teixeira is a maryland native .
teixeira was traded from atlanta to los angeles in july .
he hit . 308 with 33 homers and 121 rbis last season , including . 358 with 13 homers and 43 rbis in 54 games with the angels .
the angeles said last week they made an eight - year offer .
henry had expressed concern about a contract of eight years or more .
"we all have limits , " he wrote the ap on wednesday .
"eight years is a very long time in baseball and everywhere else . " .
he also said the amount the team is willing to spend on a free agent "depends on both" the economy and the player being sought .
