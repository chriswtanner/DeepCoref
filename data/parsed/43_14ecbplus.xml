advanced micro devices will acquire server vendor seamicro in an attempt to make a run at intel in the microserver market .
amd said it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire seamicro , a company that supplies energy - efficient microservers , for approximately $334 million .
to date , seamicro servers have been using intel's atom and xeon processors .
future plans call for seamicro to build servers with amd's opteron chips .
"amd plans to offer the first amd opteron processor - based solutions that combine amd and seamicro technology in the second half of 2012 .
the company remains firmly committed to its traditional server business , and will continue to focus and invest in this area , " amd said in a statement .
seamicro's innovations include its supercompute fabric , which connects thousands of processor cores , memory , storage , and input / output traffic .
seamicro's fabric supports multiple processor instruction sets .
"seamicro was founded to dramatically reduce the power consumed by servers , while increasing compute density and bandwidth , " said andrew feldman , seamicro ceo , who will become general manager of amd's newly created data center server solutions business .
