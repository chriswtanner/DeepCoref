the indian navy captured 23 pirates who threatened a merchant vessel in the lawless waters of the gulf of aden and a german naval helicopter thwarted another attack saturday on a freighter being chased by speedboats off yemen .
the successes came days before secretary of state condoleezza rice was to ask the united nations to authorize " all necessary measures " against increasingly bold somalian pirates operating in one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .
an indian navy ship , the ins mysore , was escorting merchant ships in waters off somalia 's coast saturday when it received a distress call from seamen on board the mv gibe , who said they were being fired on by two boats that were approaching fast .
the mysore and its helicopter sped to the scene , and the pirate boats attempted to escape when they saw them , according to a statement from the indian government .
indian marine commandoes boarded the pirate boats and seized " a substantial cache of arms and equipment , " including seven ak-47 assault rifles , three machine guns , a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and other weapons , the statement said .
they also found a gps receiver and other equipment .
the pirates were from somalia and yemen , two countries on the coast of the gulf of aden .
the gibe was flying an ethiopian flag but little else was known about it , the indian statement said .
last month , india 's navy drew criticism after sinking a thai fishing trawler that had been commandeered hours earlier by pirates .
at least one thai crew member was killed in the attack , which the indian navy had originally announced by saying it had sunk a pirate " mother ship . " .
the indian navy defended its actions , saying it had fired in self-defense .
somali pirates have become increasingly brazen and recently seized a saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million of crude oil .
many of the vessels are taken to pirate-controlled regions in somalia , where they are held for ransom .
it was not immediately clear what would happen to the pirates captured by the indians , or where they would be taken .
the statement said only that the prisoners and their weapons would be " handed over to appropriate authorities ashore . " .
most foreign navies patrolling the somali coast have been reluctant to detain suspects because of uncertainties over where they would face trial , since somalia has no effective central government or legal system .
also on saturday , a german military spokesman said a navy frigate had chased away pirates in speedboats pursuing an ethiopian freighter off the coast of yemen .
the german frigate responded to a distress call from the freighter , and a helicopter took off from the deck to investigate .
the pirates turned away from the freighter as the helicopter flew overhead , said the spokesman , who declined to give his name in line with military policy .
an estimated 1,500 pirates are based in somalia 's semiautonomous puntland region , raking in millions of dollars .
secretary of state condoleezza rice will present a draft security council resolution next week asking the united nations to authorize " all necessary measures " against piracy from somalia .
however , the commander of the u.s. navy 's 5th fleet expressed doubt friday about the wisdom of launching attacks against somali pirates on land , as the draft proposes .
u.s. vice adm. bill gortney told reporters that it is difficult to identify pirates , and the potential for killing innocent civilians " can not be overestimated . " .
the threat of pirates recently prompted a german cruise ship to evacuate some 420 passengers and crew after the company decided not to risk their safety as the ship passed through the gulf of aden .
the passengers and crew have rejoined the m/s columbus - which is on a six-month round-the-world trip - in oman 's port of salalah after three days in dubai , hamburg-based cruise operator hapag-lloyd said saturday .
the ship and a limited crew made it through the gulf without incident , a company spokeswoman said .
