with a 17-inch macbook pro update unveiled at today 's macworld 2009 keynote , apple has finally brought an entire line of mac portables into view .
the largest member of the macbook family now comes with a faster front-side bus and processor , nvidia graphics , displayport interconnect with hdcp content protection , led-backlit glossy display , and all of it wrapped up inside apple 's unibody aluminum enclosure with glass trackpad .
for the first time ever , apple is also offering a 256gb sdd upgrade , while creative pros get to order anti-glare display version of the computer .
but everybody was expecting this .
what was never dreamed of is eight hours of battery life that powers this beast - up from five hours before .
the added juice comes from a 40 % larger battery and a chip inside that " talks " to each cell and adjusts the current accordingly .
this results in three times the number of charges and lifespan of the industry standard .
the rumor mill was way off this year when it predicted a $ 600 mac netbook or iphone nano as apple 's " one more thing " for macworld 2009 .
instead , apple 's vice president of worldwide marketing phil schiller , appointed by steve jobs to deliver the keynote presentation in his absence , saved the new 17-inch macbook pro as the company 's last surprise .
apple calls the 17-inch macbook pro the " world 's lightest and thinnest 17-inch notebook , " and it is n't exaggerating .
the computer is just 0.98-inches thin and weighs 6.6 pounds. the 17-inch macbook pro represents a marriage of all the technologies used to build other unibody macbooks and a large 17-inch display for applications that require lots of screen real estate , like video editing and graphics design on-the-go .
the machine features led-backlit glossy display that lights up instantly when the lid is open , unlike warm up time required for the lcd cells .
it also features built-in isight camera and 1920 x 1200 resolution - that 's 78 percent more pixels than the 15-inch macbook pro and enough to display full 1080p hd content with room to spare .
in addition , it has a 700:1 contrast ratio and 60 % greater color gamut .
as was expected , the machine now relies exclusively on mini displayport interconnect with hdcp copy protection technology , and it comes with glass trackpad and illuminated keyboard , all wrapped in a sturdy unibody alluminum enclosure .
the new 17-inch macbook pro includes an ultra-thin , widescreen glossy 1920 x 1200 display with 78 % more pixels than the 15-inch macbook pro and a 60 % greater color gamut that delivers desktop-quality color in a notebook .
the led-backlit display has brilliant instant-on performance , uses up to 30 % less energy and eliminates the mercury found in industry standard fluorescent tube backlights .
a faster 1066 mhz front-side bus and newer generation of intel core 2 duo processor with 6mb shared l2 cache , clocked at 2.66 ghz , bring an evolutionary speed increase over the previous model .
the notebook ships with 4gb of 1066 mhz ddr3 sdram , expandable to 8gb ; onboard graphics is the same ( nvidia geforce 9400m and 9600m gt combo ) as used in the 15-inch unibody macbook pro models .
the latter discreet chip comes with 512mb gddr3 video memory and can be turned on to boost graphics performance when needed , albeit at the expense of battery .
but when it comes to battery , the lithium polymer one inside the 17-inch macbook pro squeezes up to 8 hours of runtime .
apple said it created 40 % larger environment-friendly battery without taxing computer 's sleek form factor .
the battery features adaptive charging technology and comes with a chip inside that talks to each cell to adjust the current accordingly , resulting in a three times the charges and lifespan of the industry standard .
" we 've developed new battery technology that is better for the user and better for the environment , " said apple ceo steve jobs .
" apple 's advanced chemistry and innovative technology deliver up to eight hours of use on a full charge cycle and up to 1,000 recharges . " .
the company claims that a " properly maintained " battery in this notebook will retain 80 % or more of its original capacity during a lifespan of up to 1,000 recharge cycles .
connectivity options include wireless 802.11n networking courtesy of the built-in airport extreme card , a bluetooth 2.1 + edr module and gigabit ethernet .
the machine also has one firewire 800 port for connecting video cameras and other professional audio and video equipment , three usb 2.0 ports , audio line in and out ports , each supporting both digital and analog , and expresscard/34 expansion card slot .
storage features include 320gb sata hdd running at 5400 rpm , with apple 's sudden motion sensor that prevents head to scratch platter surface if the machine is suddenly dropped , and a slot-load 8x superdrive with double-layer support .
apple will start shipping the new 17-inch macbook pro at the end of the month for $ 2,799 .
