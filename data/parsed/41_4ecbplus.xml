bombing at yida refugee camp , south sudan .
on thursday , november 10th at approximately 3 : 00 pm , the yida refugee camp in south sudan was bombed .
nonviolent peaceforce's yida protection team lives and works in the camp , providing protection monitoring and support to nearly 23 , 000 nuban refugees who have fled to south sudan to escape the escalating violent conflict across the border in sudan's south kordofan .
four bombs were dropped within just a few moments - two landed inside the camp itself , while the other two bombs were dropped near the airstrip where a un helicopter was delivering much needed food aid .
of the bombs that landed inside the camp , one detonated about a quarter mile from the np compound .
the other landed next to the school building where 300 students were attending class , but it did not explode .
tiffany ornelas , np's yida team leader , reported that "people were terrified ; they were running and screaming in all directions" .
however , there have been no casualties or fatalities confirmed as a result of this bombing .
in the days following the bombing , np's team has been working with the refugee and host communities to verify the damage to the camp , account for children who fled during the bombing , set up a safety perimeter around the unexploded bomb to prevent curious children from approaching it , and explore options to further improve the safety and security of the refugees living at the camp .
np's protection team arrived in yida one month ago to respond to the direct protection needs of the camp and host populations .
np's team of 3 international and 3 local protection officers are working to facilitate secure relations between both communities and to provide specialized support for the most vulnerable civilians , including more than 1200 unaccompanied children .
