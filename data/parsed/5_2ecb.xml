maurice cheeks was fired saturday as coach of the philadelphia 76ers , who are slumping at 9-14 a year after making the playoffs .
assistant general manager tony dileo was appointed coach for rest of the season .
the dismissal came hours before the 76ers were to play at home , with dileo making his coaching debut against washington .
team president ed stefanski said he met with cheeks , describing the former 76er star as a " gentleman throughout " and a " class act . " .
" i felt we were not progressing the way we had wanted to progress , " stefanski said .
" i did n't feel on the floor we were executing the philosophy we wanted to have as sixers basketball . " .
cheeks was one of more the popular players in 76ers history and was starting his fourth season as coach. stefanski had given cheeks two contract extensions in the past season , but the slow start was enough to cost him his job .
cheeks became the fifth nba coach fired this season following p.j. carlesimo ( oklahoma city ) , eddie jordan ( washington ) , sam mitchell ( toronto ) and randy wittman ( minnesota ) .
a message left on cheeks ' cell phone was not immediately returned .
dileo has spent 19 seasons with the 76ers .
he was promoted to senior vice president/assistant general manager in 2003 .
his son , t.j. dileo , is a guard for temple and he said after the owls ' 88-72 win over no. 8 tennessee that he was excited his father had a chance to coach .
" i think it 's unfortunate for mo , he 's a great coach , but my dad is ready to step in , " dileo said .
" this caught us by surprise .
we had no idea . " .
dileo said he had n't talked to his father yet , but noticed one missed call from him on his cell phone .
cheeks led the 76ers to the playoffs last year for the first time while he was coach .
philadelphia was one of the surprise teams in the east last season , and the 76ers anticipated a deep run in the playoffs this year .
they signed elton brand to a five-year deal worth nearly $ 80 million last summer , but they have struggled with him in the lineup and have lost eight of 10 .
last season , the 76ers lost in the first round to detroit .
after an 18-30 start , philadelphia won 18 of its next 23 games and wound up at 40-42 , the sixth seed in the eastern conference .
stefanski rewarded cheeks with two contract extensions in seven months that would have taken him to the end of next season .
instead , with the team on a three-game losing streak and last in the atlantic division , he did n't even last until the end of the calendar year .
cheeks also coached at portland .
he played 15 seasons in the nba , the first 11 with philadelphia , and retired in 1993 .
an outstanding defensive player , cheeks played in four all-star games and was a member of the 76ers ' championship team in 1982-83 .
his no. 10 jersey hangs in the rafters .
