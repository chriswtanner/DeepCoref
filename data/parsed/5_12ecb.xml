never before in nba history have coaches fallen this early in the season in such numbers .
now , maurice cheeks became the nba 's fifth coaching casualty of the season .
on saturday , cheeks was fired as head coach of the philadelphia 76ers .
with the off-season acquisition of elton brand , the 2008-09 season was supposed to be a good one for the sixers .
unfortunately , it has n't played out that way to date .
despite leading the team in scoring , brand has not yet lived up to expectations and the rest of the team also has struggled .
the sixers have a record of 9-14 and had been expected to be a playoff contender in the eastern conference .
according to the associated press , the dismissal came hours before the 76ers were to play at home saturday night , with dileo now making his coaching debut against washington .
dileo has spent 19 seasons with the 76ers .
he was promoted to senior vice president/assistant general manager in 2003 .
cheeks was one of more the popular players in 76ers history and was starting his fourth season as coach .
gm ed stefanski had given cheeks two contract extensions in the past season , but the slow start was enough to cost him his job .
