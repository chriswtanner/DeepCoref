during the promotional period for the hunger games everyone involved made sure to note how different the franchise was from twilight .
while it may have seemed like a silly thing to do given twilight's success , but the truth is that comparisons were making male audiences a bit shaky about the film , as that demographic didn't want to spend two and a half hours watching a tween romance ( and hunger games is definitely not that ) .
the film obviously wasn't hurt by this strategy , as it went on to shatter records and become the third highest grossing opening weekend title of all time .
but while the story of the hunger games may have no comparison to twilight , it turns out that action behind the scenes may duplicate it .
while the first movie was a huge success , thr is saying that director gary ross is still in negotiations to direct the sequel , catching fire .
the stars of the film - the ones that survived , anyway - are already contractually obligated to appear in the second movie , but things haven't been going to great on the filmmaker side .
the trade says that ross' negotiations with lionsgate the first time around weren't so hot either , an inside source calling it "a terrible experience , " as the studio doesn't usually pay "seasoned - filmmaker fees" to even seasoned filmmakers like ross . ?
because of the hunger games' big box office numbers , ross is expecting a raise for his work on the movie ( he was given $3 million upfront and 5% on the backend with his first deal ) but it's unclear if the studio will give it to him .
much like the twilight franchise , or even harry potter , it's entirely possible that lionsgate will choose not to pay ross and instead go with another filmmaker who is demanding less money .
a script has already been written for catching fire , from simon beaufoy , but ross has not yet had the chance to revise it .
the one big card that ross has in his back pocket is that the hunger games was better received than any of the twilight films , which could convince the brass to try and keep some consistency .
whether it will play in his favor is still an unknown at this point .
so what do you think ?
should ross be brought back for the next movie or should they go with someone else's vision ?
