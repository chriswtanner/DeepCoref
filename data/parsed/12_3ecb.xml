striking another blow against the pirates infesting the waters off the horn of africa , an indian navy warship not only repulsed an attack on a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden , but nabbed 23 somali and yemeni sea brigands .
the pirates , in three boats , were attempting to hijack the ethopian-flagged merchant vessel around noon today , when the destroyer ins mysore intervened and repulsed the attack , a navy spokesman said here .
the incident took place about 150 nautical miles off aden .
after the mysore picked up a distress call from the merchant vessel , mv gibe , at around 11 a.m. saying it was under attack , it immediately lauched its helicopter and headed for the scene .
on sighting the helicopter and the mysore , the pirates broke off their attack and attempted to escape , but the warship chased them down .
marine commandos boarded two of the pirate vessels to nab 12 somali and 11 yemeni pirates .
nine assault rifles , a grenade launcher , 13 fully loaded magazines and a gps receiver were seized from the pirates , the navy spokesman said .
the larger boat , a 10-metre dhow , is named the salahaddin .
it had a smaller boat , a skiff , under tow , navy sources said .
the ins mysore later escorted the mv gibe to safety .
the pirates are being held on board the mysore and will be handed over to appropriate authorities ashore , possibly at djibouti in ivory coast , the warship 's next port of call .
today 's operation is the fourth successful offensive by the navy in the heart of the pirates ' zone of operations .
last month , the ins tabar , a missile-frigate , had sunk a thai trawler that was being used as a mothership by the pirates and also rescued two merchant vessels that were under attack .
the mysore , a 6,900-tonne destroyer , replaced the tabar on patrol in the region about a fortnight ago .
dozen of warships of several countries are also patrolling the shipping lanes in the gulf of aden .
india 's recent pro-active approach against piracy reflects the concern of the maritime community over a new surge in hijackings off somalia .
the international maritime bureau has reported that pirates based in the lawless african nation were now " out of control " .
new delhi had taken a serious view of piracy-related incidents in the region following the hijacking of mv stolt valor , with 18 indian sailors on board , by somali pirates in september this year .
on 23 october , the government gave a go-ahead to the navy 's request for a pro-active approach against the pirates .
