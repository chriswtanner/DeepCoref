both chipmakers are bullish about combining , but a key issue for them will be convincing skeptics they should join together in the first place .
advanced micro devices ( amd ) chief executive hector ruiz waxed metaphorical as he described his company 's acquisition of ati technologies ( atyt ) .
chipmaker amd , hoping to gain a leg up on a resurgent rival intel ( intc ) , on july 24 ended months of speculation by saying it would buy graphics chipmaker ati for about $ 5.4 billion .
" we will move from being neighbors to being a family , " ruiz told analysts on a conference call .
the two companies have long partnered in the competitive market for chips that run personal computers and consumer electronics .
but under the same roof , the companies will focus on innovations that are particularly attractive to corporate and mobile-computing customers , ruiz believes .
the enlarged chipmaker will combine amd 's strength in fast-computing power with ati 's specialty in delivering detailed graphics onto a single , low-cost chip .
but the problem with families-especially those formed by multibillion-dollar corporate mergers-is that they often end up dysfunctional .
promised cost savings and sales increases do n't always pan out , and integration of disparate cultures and operations is frequently fraught with value-destroying rifts .
maybe that 's why intel and nvidia ( nvda ) , the companies ' two biggest rivals , found a lot to smile about on july 24 , the day the deal was announced .
" i thought it was just impossible to get a gift like this , " crowed nvidia ceo jen-hsun huang , in an interview with businessweek.com .
ati is " basically throwing in the towel , leaving us as the only stand-alone ( graphics chip ) company in the world . " .
intel , the world 's largest graphics-chipmaker , declined to comment specifically on the deal .
but company execs have noted intel continues to improve its own graphics chipsets and that it expects to deliver platforms of products , like centrino , that amd can not easily match .
investors were n't too sure how happy the amd and ati family will turn out to be , either .
amd shares fell almost 5 % on july 24 , to $ 17.40 , extending recent declines fueled by concern amd will be the biggest loser amid an escalating pc industry price war .
" the assumption of a significant amount of new debt and the need to address integration issues at a time when amd has been seeking to step up its competitive pressure in a fierce environment with intel is likely to weigh on amd 's share , " lehman brothers semiconductor analyst tim luke noted in a report .
indeed , amd and ati could be distracted from their core businesses for months as they combine into a company with $ 7.3 billion in annual sales and 15,000 employees sprawled through canada , california , and texas .
credit-rating agency fitch ratings lowered its outlook on amd 's debt to negative from positive on concern the chipmaker 's debt-to-capital ratio will jump to 37 % from less than 10 % because of a $ 2.5 billion term loan it is using to partially finance the deal .
the merger also could lock ati out of the business of supplying graphics chipsets to intel-based pcs , worth about $ 90 million a year in revenue .
ati chipsets connect to intel 's processor through what 's known as a front side bus , which serves as a highway for transferring data .
but amd , under a different licensing deal with intel , is not allowed to use that front side bus .
" we are evaluating the deal , and have got a lot to figure out how it would fit in with our existing agreements with both ati and amd , " intel spokesman chuck mulloy says .
and while ati and amd are busy ironing out their new relationship , intel and nvidia are rolling out some heavy-hitting chips of their own .
intel and its pc partners on july 27 begin shipping for the first chips in a brand-new pc architecture called core 2 duo ( see businessweek.com , 7/24/06 , " intel sharpens its offensive game " ) .
first up will be desktop chips , followed closely by new energy-sipping chips for notebook pcs .
core 2 duo is expected to wrest the performance crown in the mainstream pc market from amd for the first time in more than two years .
amd will not get a chance to grab it back until mid-2007 , when it is fully ramped on a new manufacturing process .
meantime , nvidia is prepping to deliver a new high-end graphics chip later this year that company executives herald as the biggest leap forward in nearly a decade .
after a high-profile delay in delivering a new chip in 2001 , nvidia has been steadily taking market share from ati in the lucrative market supplying screaming-fast graphic cards to the discriminating gaming community .
amd says there 's plenty of reason to be bullish on the deal .
the company has its sights on markets where nvidia and intel are not as strong .
amd president dirk meyer hopes to use ati 's chipset business to develop an energy-sipping combo processing and graphics chip that can be paired with software partners to deliver a platform better able to compete with intel 's new vpro offering .
intel has won early praise from software companies and large businesses for vpro , which bakes security and virtualization directly into the chip .
with vpro , tech administrators managing thousands of pcs could partition parts of the system from workers-a feature that could keep viruses from rapidly spreading across corporate networks .
and ati 's growing business of providing graphics chipsets to cell-phone makers nokia ( nok ) and motorola ( mot ) also will give it up a leg up over intel , he said .
intel recently sold its cellular chip business to marvell technology ( mrvl ) for $ 600 million .
" customers want to get better mobile offerings and more stable commercial offerings , but they want to know that we 're still going to offer them the ability to choose , " meyer says .
even if relations between amd and nvidia turn frosty and ati loses intel 's business , amd executives predict a combined offering would bring in an additional $ 300 million in revenue in the pc realm alone for every share point gained against intel .
still , not everyone 's sold. pip coburn , founder of tech advisory firm coburn ventures , notes amd has pinned its success on a range of variables .
" i do n't want six reasons , " coburn says, .
" i want two reasons , two good reasons . " .
amd 's meyer says he knows the company has some heavy lifting ahead .
" the integration task is going to require focus , " he says .
the biggest job , however , may be convincing skeptics this family was worth forming in the first place .
