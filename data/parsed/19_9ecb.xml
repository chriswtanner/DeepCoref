the clashes broke out as candlelit vigils were being held to mark a week since the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy , which triggered the riots that are threatening the stability of the government .
youths - some on foot , others riding motorcycles - attacked a police station with petrol bombs in central athens as well as at least three banks , several stores and a government building , police said .
several hundred protesters set up burning barricades and attacked police with rocks and flares. riot police fired tear gas and chased the youths through parts of the city .
the protesters chanted " murderers out " and used laser pointers to target police for attack .
violence has wracked greece every day since the death of teenager alexandros grigoropoulos .
the riots in cities throughout the country has left at least 70 people injured .
hundreds of stores have been smashed and looted , and more than 200 people have been arrested .
while most of the protesters have been peaceful , the tone of the demonstrations has been set by a violent fringe .
and more young people have been willing to join those fringe elements than in the past .
hundreds of school children holding candles gathered peacefully saturday outside parliament and at the site where teenager was shot .
outside parliament , they left candles spelling out the name " alex " in front of a line of riot policemen .
the young protesters promised to remain on the streets until their concerns - including opposition to increasingly unpopular government and worry over economic issues - are addressed .
" speaking as an anarchist , we want to create those social conditions that will generate more uprisings and to get more people out in the streets to demand their rights , " said 32-year-old protester paris kyriakides .
" in the end , the violence that we use is minimal in comparison to the violence of the system uses , like the banks , " kyriakides said .
earlier saturday , a crowd of about 1,000 people attended a peaceful sit-down demonstration in athens and another 1,000 demonstrated in the northern city of thessaloniki .
one 16-year-old student at the athens demonstration , who gave only her first name , veatriki , said young people her age felt their voices were being heard immediately when they smashed a shop window or a car .
she also said young people want to see the policemen involved in the shooting punished and the police disarmed .
the two officers involved in the boy 's shooting have been arrested .
one was charged with murder and the other as an accomplice .
the circumstances surrounding the shooting remain unclear .
giorgos kyrtsos , publisher of the city press and free sunday newspapers , said the violent demonstrations revealed widespread public discontent .
" we are entering a long period of economic crisis , " kyrtsos said .
" but there is also a deepening social crisis , combined with a weakened state .
we are truly at a crossroads . " .
kyrtsos , a conservative , was highly critical of the government 's handling of the protests .
" this is the only government i remember that has managed to alienate both the rebellious youth and the law-and-order crowd , " he said .
" it has nothing to offer to anybody . " .
christmas shoppers cautiously returned to central athens earlier saturday , but many stores had boarded up their windows instead of replacing the glass , for fear of further violence .
athens mayor nikitas kaklamanis greeted shoppers with the city 's brass band .
" people came up to me and were telling me that it was the first time they had smiled in days , " the mayor said .
