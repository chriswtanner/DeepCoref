'hunger games' director gary ross in tough negotiation for sequel .
8 : 00 am pdt 4 / 4 / 2012 .
despite the movie's box - office records , the director isn't locked up as lionsgate could pull a "twilight" - style switcheroo over money .
now that the hunger games is a hit with more than $363 million in the till , the question is whether writer - director gary ross will return for the next installment in the lucrative lionsgate franchise .
unlike stars jennifer lawrence , josh hutcherson and liam hemsworth , ross is not signed for a sequel .
and negotiations for him to do the first movie were "a terrible experience , " says a source with knowledge of the discussions , because ross is a seasoned filmmaker ( pleasantville , seabiscuit ) and lionsgate isn't accustomed to paying seasoned - filmmaker fees .
he ended up taking a relatively low $3 million to write ( with billy ray and novelist suzanne collins ) and direct .
but he will collect a very remunerative 5 percent of backend .
sources say ross , 55 , would like a significant raise for a second hunger games , but lionsgate didn't kick off negotiations with him until about three weeks before the first film's march 23 opening .
by then , with tracking suggesting a huge opening weekend , ross and his caa reps were in no hurry to bargain .
lionsgate has a script from simon beaufoy ( slumdog millionaire ) that ross has yet to revise .
the studio is in a rush to start the next film in the fall , though fox might upset lionsgate's plan by exercising its option on lawrence to start another x - men movie first .
( fox's option would trump lionsgate's hold on lawrence , say sources . ) .
adding urgency : lionsgate already has booked a november 2013 release for hunger games : catching fire .
with other big literary properties , directors have been seen as fungible .
warner bros . entrusted the first two harry potter films to chris columbus before employing a host of other filmmakers , and summit memorably did not invite catherine hardwicke back to direct the second twilight , despite the success of the first installment .
( and summit's rob friedman and patrick wachsberger now run lionsgate's film division . ) .
but ross will argue that his film was much better received than any in the twilight series , with an a cinemascore and an 85 percent "fresh" rating on rotten tomatoes in addition to huge worldwide box office .
he'll contend that the movie will play longer and stronger in theaters and that he could direct his pick of other movies should lionsgate refuse to pony up .
( but to state the obvious , hunger games' bi - gender story line appeals to a wider audience than twilight . ) .
it's always striking when a giant hit leads to anger and hurt feelings in hollywood , but that seems to be the case here .
nonetheless , sources involved with the franchise are betting that ross will return .
"ultimately , it will be difficult , and yet everybody will do the sane thing , which is to work it out , " says one .
"everybody will end up unhappy in their own way .
it's just the nature of the beast . " .
