with last night 's news from los angeles angels gm tony reagins that the team has made an eight-year contract offer ( dollars undisclosed ) to 1b mark teixeira , the trade rumor being reported , most recently by john perrotto at baseball prospectus , about the angels going after san diego padres ' ace is likely caput .
perrotto 's iteration had aaa rhp nick adenhart and aaa ss brandon wood heading a package that would lead to peavy topping the angels ' rotation .
while the angels are being lumped in with the big spenders of baseball ( read : new york yankees and boston red sox ) , there is little to indicate the angels ' off-season plans included dropping $ 20mm per on teixeira and another $ 15 + mm on a starting pitcher .
as a back-up plan to a failure to land teixeira , yes .
however , an interesting scenario develops if teixeira spurs the west coast in favor of working closer to home for the washington nationals or baltimore orioles .
in this scenario , the angels would have the luxury of dealing peavy to the padres for a wood/adenhart/reggie willits/reliever package , and reviving its offense with the signings of non-tender 3b/2b ty wigginton and jonny gomes .
