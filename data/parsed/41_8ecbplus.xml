sudan bombs south sudanese refugee camp , reports say .
11 / 10 / 11 02 : 39 pm et .
military aircraft from sudan crossed the new international border with south sudan and dropped bombs thursday in and around a camp filled with refugees , officials said .
a government official initially reported deaths , but an american activist who spoke to aid workers at the camp later said there were no casualties .
there was no immediate comment from the sudanese government in khartoum on thursday , as deadly fighting broke out in the sudanese state of south kordofan between the military and forces loyal to south sudan , according to official sudanese media .
meanwhile , the violence in and near the yida refugee camp , located 10 miles ( 15 kilometers ) south of the border , came one day after bombings were reported in another region of south sudan , an attack that provoked strong condemnation from the u . s . state department .
the president of south sudan , which became the world's newest country only four months ago , said he fears the khartoum - based government intends to invade the south soon .
"whatever allegations khartoum labels against the republic of south sudan are baseless , but intended to justify his pending invasion of the south , " president salva kiir said .
he later added : "we are committed to peaceful resolutions to any conflict but we will never allow our sovereignty to be violated by anybody . " .
the violence is especially troubling given the history between the two sides : the black african tribes of south sudan and the mainly arab north battled two civil wars over more than five decades , and some 2 million died in the latest war , from 1983 - 2005 .
a peace deal ended the war and south sudan became its own country in july after a successful independence referendum .
but there have been lingering disputes over border demarcation and oil - sharing revenues .
ryan boyette , a former aid worker who lives in sudan who is now leading a team of 15 citizen journalists , said he talked to five aid workers in the yida camp , all of whom said that four bombs were dropped but that they caused no casualties .
boyette said a u . n . helicopter had landed on a nearby airstrip right as the first bomb hit .
one of the bombs landed in a school yard where about 300 students were attending class , but the bomb did not explode , boyette said , citing aid workers at the camp .
aleem siddique , a u . n . spokesman in south sudan , said : "we're concerned for the safety of civilians in the area following reports of explosions and we are liaising with the authorities . " .
jonathan hutson , a spokesman for the u . s . advocacy group the enough project , said aid workers inside the yida refugee camp said at least one bomb landed in the camp , and three or four fell outside it .
the aid workers or their groups could not be named for security reasons , hutson said .
hutson said at least 15 , 000 refugees who fled violence in sudan are living in the yida camp .
they walked at least seven days to reach the camp , he said .
miabek lang , the commissioner of pariang county in south sudan's unity state , said earlier that 12 people were killed and 20 were wounded in thursday's bombing .
lang could not be reached again for clarification on the conflicting reports .
the wednesday bombings in upper nile state sparked condemnation from the u . s . state department , which said the "unacceptable and unjustified" attacks increase the potential of conflict between sudan and south sudan .
south sudan's president said thursday that seven people were killed in those bombings .
john prendergast , the co - founder of the enough project , said the regime in khartoum , sudan's capital , is attempting to provoke south sudan into restarting a war .
"the regime's end game is to either capture south sudan's oil fields along their common border , or achieve a stronger negotiating position on shared oil revenues and border demarcation , " prendergast said .
"this provocation must be countered by the full force of the international community , or else a massive war could unfold . " .
south sudan's oil reserves must be pumped through pipelines that run through sudan .
splitting the oil revenues has long been a major sticking point between the two sides .
another major issue is the demarcation of the border .
though the countries are now separate an official border has not yet been laid down .
sudan has accused south sudan of arming pro - south sudan groups in its territory .
but kiir said thursday that the accusations from khartoum are "smoke screens" to mask sudan's support of armed groups fighting a proxy war against south sudan .
his comments came as sudan said an unspecified number of rebels , soldiers and civilians were killed in clashes in the border state of south kordofan in the town of talodi on thursday .
sudanese army spokesman khaled saad , quoted in the official news agency suna , said the military had repelled a planned attack by forces loyal to the southern movement , or sudan people's liberation army , who hail from a minority ethnic group now in control of much of south sudan .
