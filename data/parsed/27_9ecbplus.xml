microsoft rushes urgent fix for internet explorer .
it " s not patch tuesday , but microsoft has released a crucial update for internet explorer that you should apply immediately .
microsoft included a cumulative update for internet explorer in the 13 security bulletins that made up patch tuesday last week , and that update was considered critical as well .
since then , though , a new flaw has been targeted by attacks in the wild , so microsoft has responded with an out - of - band update .
apply the urgent fix - it solution from microsoft to protect internet explorer from exploits .
the update from microsoft is a fix - it tool , which is more of a stop - gap bandage than an actual patch .
applying the fix - it will protect internet explorer and prevent the currently circulating exploit from working on your systems .
paul henry , security and forensic analyst with lumension , says that there are number of mitigating factors that limit the potential scope of this threat , but those factors may offer little consolation for many users .
" the bad news is that this is a very wide - reaching patch , affecting all versions of ie across all operating systems , from xp to rt , " he says .
"and more bad news : the average user is very susceptible to being hit with this . " .
microsoft claims that running internet explorer in enhanced security configuration mode prevents this attack .
internet explorer runs in this restricted mode by default on windows server 2008 , windows server 2008 r2 , windows server 2012 , and windows server 2012 r2 .
microsoft states that all supported versions of outlook , outlook express , and windows mail include protection by default as well .
html email messages are opened by default in the restricted sites security zone , which disables scripts and activex controls necessary for the exploit to execute .
however , microsoft cautions that the protection in outlook only applies to the html message within outlook itself .
if a user receives an email with a link and clicks on it , they " re still potentially vulnerable because the threat is now web - based and functioning outside of outlook .
" the average user does not run the restricted sites mode , are not using the enhanced security configuration and are all - too - willing to click on phishing emails , " henry explains , "i recommend employing the mitigating factors , as well as advising users about this so they will be less likely to click malicious links until you can apply the patch .
it " s been a while since we " ve seen an out - of - band patch for ie from microsoft , but it " s still important to apply it as soon as possible . " .
" it's important to reiterate that all versions of ie are affected including the internet explorer 11 preview , tyler reguly , technical manager of security research and development for tripwire , says .
"since attacks are occurring now , this is a situation where it's in everyone's best interest for microsoft to release a patch as soon as possible .
in the meantime , install the shim that they've released . " .
he adds , " for less technical users that aren't comfortable with microsoft fix it solutions , using another browser until a patch is available is the best option , " .
a couple additional notes : the fix - it solution only works with 32 - bit versions of internet explorer , and you must first apply the cumulative update for internet explorer from last week " s patch tuesday ( ms13 - 069 ) .
