a series of earthquakes killed a 10-year-old girl and injured dozens sunday in remote eastern indonesia and briefly triggered fears of another tsunami in a country still recovering from such a disaster in 2004 .
one of the quakes -- a 7.3-magnitude tremor -- was felt as far away as australia and sent small tsunamis into japan 's southeastern coast .
residents near the epicenter in papua province rushed from their homes in search of higher ground shortly after the first 7.6-magnitude quake struck , afraid that huge waves might wash over the island .
the epicenter was about 85 miles from papua 's main city of manokwari and occurred at a depth of 22 miles , the u.s. geological survey said .
it was followed by dozens of aftershocks .
