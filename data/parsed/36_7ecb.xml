rcmp make arrests in bc polygamous community .
police have moved in and arrested at least two men from the religious community of bountiful in the bc interior .
bc attorney general wally opal issued a statement today saying that two men , winston blackmore and james oler , had been arrested " on charges of polygamy pursuant to the criminal code . " .
opal says the arrests are the product of a seven-month charge assessment review by special prosecutor terrence robertson .
opal points out that this prosecution is independent of both the criminal justice branch and the bc government .
critics have said it would be difficult to pursue polygamy charges against members of bountiful for fear that criminal prosecution could violate their religious freedoms .
