mark felt , the mysterious " deep throat " source who helped washington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein crack the watergate scandal that brought down president richard nixon , has died at age 95 .
felt suffered from congestive heart failure but the exact cause of his death at home on thursday was not immediately known , said the press democrat newspaper in santa rosa , california , 55 miles ( 90 km ) north of san francisco .
in its report on felt 's death , the new york times called him " the most famous anonymous source in american history . " .
felt , the no. 2 official at the fbi when the watergate case broke , kept his role in the story a secret for 30 years .
only in 2005 , at age 91 , was his part made public in an article in vanity fair magazine written by felt 's family lawyer .
" i 'm the guy they used to call deep throat , " felt told attorney john o'connor .
for years , people had speculated and argued about the identity of " deep throat , " whose name was derived from the title of a popular pornographic movie .
vanity fair scooped woodward and bernstein , who had promised not to reveal the name of the star source of their 1974 stories until after his death .
but within a day of felt 's unveiling , woodward wrote of his relationship with felt .
woodward said he turned to felt after he and bernstein wrote about the break-in at the offices of the democratic national committee at the watergate complex in washington .
