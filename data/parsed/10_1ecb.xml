according to this l.a. times story ( which credits the team-owned flagship radio station ) , the angels have made an eight-year offer to free agent first baseman mark teixeira .
the dollar amount was unspecified , but bill shaikin , the fine reporter who wrote the story , says the team was believed to have offered at least $ 160 million .
this , obviously , changes the landscape of the teixeira sweepstakes , as the nationals ' best chance for landing him was to blow everyone else out of the water with their offer -- which , apparently , has not happened .
that 's not to say the nationals can not sweeten their offer , but team officials have indicated an unwillingness to get into a bidding war with higher-revenue teams .
of course , we still have yet to hear from the red sox -- or even the yankees , as i hypothesized in today 's print edition .
in any case , it appears this thing is far from over .
