on monday , we reported on rumors that t-mobile would release the rim blackberry curve 8900 on february 11 , and while the date has not been confirmed , the carrier did go ahead and make the official product announcement on tuesday .
yes , the blackberry curve 8900 will make its way to t-mobile some time in february and is being touted as the thinnest and lightest full qwerty blackberry to date .
as expected , it will have integrated bluetooth and gps and we now know it will have built-in wi-fi as well as support for t-mobile 's unlimited hotspot calling service .
unfortunately , there is no 3g love .
there are plenty of other highlights , though , including a 3.2-megapixel camera , a 3.5mm headphone jack , a microsd/sdhc expansion slot ( supports up to 16gb cards ) , and a 512mhz processor .
pricing and an official release date were not released , but customers can sign up for alerts on t-mobile 's web site .
