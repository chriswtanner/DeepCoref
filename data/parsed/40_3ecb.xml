apple on tuesday launched a refresh of the 17-inch macbook pro , giving the company 's largest laptop an eight-hour battery life , a faster intel ( nsdq : intc ) processor , and better graphics capabilities .
the upgraded product was the only hardware announcement at the opening macworld keynote , which was delivered by phil schiller , senior vp for worldwide product marketing at apple .
breaking with tradition , the company announced late last month that co-founder and chief executive steve jobs would not kick off the trade show .
in addition , apple stunned the industry by saying this year would be its last appearance at macworld .
the absence of jobs led many analysts to believe that apple would not make any major product announcements , and the prediction turned out to be correct , particularly in terms of hardware .
the macbook was the only apple computer to get an upgrade , which is sure to disappoint fans who had also hoped for updates to the company 's mac mini and apple tv .
apple observers had expected the refresh of the 17-inch macbook pro , given that it was left out of apple 's notebook event in october , when the company launched updates of the 15-inch and 13.3-inch systems .
but while some analysts said the larger laptop could get a big speed boost with an intel quad-core processor , apple stuck with an intel dual-core chip , which has been upgraded to a 2.66-ghz core 2 duo processor with 6 mb of on-chip l2 cache .
buyers also have the option of a 2.93-ghz core 2 duo processor .
but the most innovative feature in the upgrade is a new battery that apple claims will last up to eight hours on a single charge and can be recharged up to 1,000 times , which means up to a five-year lifespan .
rivalsdell ( dell ) and hewlett-packard ( nyse : hpq ) last year introduced laptops with similar battery life on a single charge .
the apple battery achieves its better performance by using custom-designed lithium-polymer cells that are 40 % larger than the previous generation .
however , to fit the battery in the system , apple has made it nonremovable , which may turn off some potential buyers .
because of the extended lifespan of the battery , apple says the macbook is more environmentally friendly than the previous generation , since the power supply does n't have to be replaced so often .
the notebook is less than an inch thick , weighs 6.6 pounds , and features a light-emitting diode screen with a $ 50 anti-glare option .
in addition , the system comes with an nvidia geforce 9400m integrated graphics processor and a discrete nvidia 9600m gt processor .
switching to the latter gives better graphics performance at the expense of about an hour of battery life .
