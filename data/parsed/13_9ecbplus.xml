matanuska maid building burns down .
august 7 , 2012 - 5 : 46 pm .
alaska lost part of its history on tuesday , when a pre - dawn blaze demolished the old matanuska maid dairy warehouse building in palmer .
the matanuska maid dairy building was located on the nine acre site on which stand many structures dating back to colony days .
in the afternoon sun , only charred rubble remained .
" and it " s , of course , as you can see , a total loss , " palmer public safety director jon owen said at the site of the fire tuesday .
" we have a light breeze , as you " ve noticed , has picked up .
and the breeze has ignited a hot spot over there .
we " re just making sure that the scene is safe .
our crews are going to be out here all day . " .
palmer firemen were hosing down hotspots on the rubble of the old mat maid building late tuesday , after the early morning fire demolished the antique structure in palmer " s historic district .
owen says the fire call came in at 3 : 30 a . m .
" the palmer fire chief and the palmer police arrived within a minute or two , " owen said .
" the fire chief drove around the perimeter of this nine acre city block and saw fire coming out from under the eaves of this building . " .
" within a moment or two , the entire roof was engulfed in flame . " .
owen says palmer and mat su central fire departments responded with ladder trucks , to allow firefighters to attack the blaze from above .
he says the firemen also had to protect nearby buildings .
" it " s called surround and drown , when you are fighting from the air , " owen said .
" and the big thing was we had to protect crowley petroleum , from the fire from spreading to the gas and the petroleum products that are stored at crowley petroleum , right next store here , because of the danger of an entire conflagration . " .
state fire marshall john bond surveyed the scene tuesday afternoon to help determine the cause of the fire .
not much was left of the building except some charred wooden beams and metal remnants which had plunged into the building " s basement .
the heat of the blaze was so intense it melted the paint off nearby cars .
the old building was in private ownership .
last year , palmer voters approved a bond measure allowing the city to purchase the historic district containing the mat maid building and several other wooden structures .
those plans have not been finalized yet .
owen says it will be about a month before a final determination as to the cause of the fires is known .
director owen says no injuries have been reported in the blaze .
he said there was no power or gas on in the building , nor was lightening a possible cause .
