the bush administration is reducing protections for endangered animals and plants .
just six weeks before democratic president-elect barack obama takes office , the current republican administration is changing endangered species regulations .
some mandatory , independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years are being eliminated .
the scientists ' advice from such reviews can delay or block dams , highways and other projects .
the new rules will take effect in about 30 days .
the rules also prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effect on endangered species and the places they live from a project 's contribution to increased global warming .
obama has promised to reverse the new rules .
congress also could overturn them .
