one place lindsay is finding this particularly difficult though is at the betty ford centre , where the actress has just finished 30 days' worth of treatment and has decided that the renowned facilities there won't be enough to keep her around for her court - ordered 90 - day stay in rehab , so she's gone elsewhere .
according to a report from tmz published this week ( june 13 ) , the mean girls actress has had enough of the palm springs rehab centre and has decided to spend the rest of her court - ordered stay in a rehab centre in malibu , named the cliffside .
lindsay hasn't messed around in getting to the new facility either and she is reportedly already a patient of the cliffside rehab centre , having checked out of the betty ford centre on thursday ( june 13 ) this week and committing herself to cliffside almost immediately afterward .
