wladimir klitschko stops tony thompson in 6 with efficient execution .
heavyweight champion wladimir klitschko once again displayed his dominance by scoring a sixth round stoppage against american contender tony thompson .
klitschko utilized good ring smarts and superior punching power to systematically break thompson down .
the first round started cautiously with both fighters becoming reacquainted with each other in a tentative feeling out process .
tony was exhibiting his trademark awkward movement and wladimir was measuring him with the left rangefinder .
it was a relatively even round without much action , but klitschko landed the two best shots of the round even if tony threw a little more .
thompson tried jumping on wladimir to start the second but the champion was prepared .
klitschko followed this with a nice right hand followed by a short crisp combination .
later in the round another klitschko right snuck in , and then a series of big rights backed the challenger into the ropes .
thompson was wrestled down to the canvas a couple of times in this stanza , and wlad " s superior strength was evident .
klitschko was patient and measured , and his approach was paying off in round two .
in between rounds hall of fame trainer emanuel steward told klitschko he was mentally wearing thompson down with pressure , and this certainly appeared to be the case .
in round three klitschko was again using his left hand to block jabs and establish range .
klitschko was looking almost exclusively for right hands , and was not using the authoritative jab we are accustomed to seeing because of thompson " s awkwardness .
thompson was throwing jabs that were mostly being blocked or missing the mark .
while it was obvious thompson was having success in neutralizing wlad's jab , he was also being peppered with klitschko right hands that were inflicting far more damage than anything thompson was throwing .
wladimir finally landed a solid jab almost halfway through the round , but his right hand was still the story of the fight .
thompson landed a decent left later in the round , but klitschko was too elusive for him for the most part .
it was another clear round for the champion .
the fourth round was more of the same .
the action was highlighted by a thudding right and a well timed combination from the champion .
before the start of the fifth , steward urged wladimir to throw more jabs and to spend less time waiting in between attacks .
as has been the case many times in the past , klitschko responded to steward " s instructions and executed with workmanlike precision .
he started landing the jab more , and this enabled him to score with a booming right hand that sent thompson crashing to the canvas .
tony rose to his feet and the action resumed with about 20 seconds left .
the challenger held on to survive , but this was perhaps the beginning of the end .
thompson came out to start the sixth and seemed to have regained his equilibrium .
he was bouncing around , reacting to klitschko " s feints , and mostly retreating in a defensive posture .
as the round progressed he was trying to fling the jab out , but klitschko was slowly measuring him up , cool as an assassin .
klitschko began throwing the infrequent jab and landing more big rights .
thompson was trying his best to survive , but then a vicious two - handed assault sent thompson down for the second time .
to his credit , he managed to rise to his feet , but the referee then waved it off .
this was klitschko " s second victory over thompson , and with it he improves to 58 - 3 with 51 wins coming by way of knockout .
slowly but surely , wladimir klitschko is beginning to establish a strong legacy for himself .
he may not always have the most crowd pleasing style , but he is intelligent , powerful , consistent , and extremely efficient at executing his game plan .
the epix broadcast of the match made note of the following all - time heavyweight records in title fights .
heavyweight title fights .
joe louis 26 - 1 .
muhammad ali 22 - 3 .
larry holmes 21 - 5 .
wladimir klitschko 19 - 2 .
lennox lewis 15 - 2 - 1 .
now of course this includes klitschko " s title reign as wbo champion as well as his current reign which began when he captured the ibf strap from chris byrd .
many critics will note that the wbo was not universally recognized in high regard at the time klitschko held that title .
even still , however , klitschko has won 16 fights in a row since losing to lamon brewster in april 2004 , and he was won 13 title fights in a row since his april 2006 victory over byrd .
beyond that , he has rarely lost a round during that impressive stretch .
given the current state of the heavyweight landscape , it is not inconceivable that klitschko may well top that list before all is said and done .
