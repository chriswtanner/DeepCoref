saints rb pierre thomas placed on injured reserve .
the new orleans saints placed pierre thomas on injured reserve wednesday because of an ankle injury .
thomas missed nine games this season because of the injury , including the regular - season finale .
he is the second running back in two days to be placed on injured reserve .
chris ivory was placed on the list tuesday .
that means former seahawk julius jones and reggie bush will likely get most of the workload .
"we've just got to get the next guy up and make sure we're prepared , " new orleans coach sean payton said in a conference call with seattle - area reporters .
so is the next guy in line jones ?
"i wouldn't assume he's taking the bulk of the carries , " payton said .
"i was in dallas when we drafted him so i'm familiar with the player .
he's filled in in a real good role for us .
i think he's smart .
he's someone that typically does the right thing , and the other thing is , he's healthy .
so from a repetition standpoint , he's gotten x number of carries and plays , but not too many .
so what's most important now on a short week for both teams is being rested both physically and mentally and prepared to play in this game , and i know he will be . " .
