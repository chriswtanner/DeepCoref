mark 'deep throat ' felt dead at 95 .
we 're all learning this morning of the death , at age 95 , of w. mark felt , who as a senior federal bureau of investigation official , served as the shadowy source known as " deep throat " to reporter bob woodward in his investigation of the watergate scandal that led to president nixon 's resignation .
as johanna neuman writes in a los angeles times piece .
a controversial figure who was later convicted of authorizing illegal activities in pursuit of members of the radical weather underground , felt died of heart failure thursday at his home in santa rosa , calif. , his grandson rob jones said .
felt was deputy associate director of the fbi in 1972 when he began supplying information to bob woodward , who with carl bernstein made up the post 's investigative duo who doggedly pursued the story of the watergate break-in and a conspiracy that led directly to president richard m. nixon , who ultimately resigned .
the reporters continued to keep felt 's name a secret , but in 2005 , at the age of 91 , felt told vanity fair magazine , " i 'm the guy they used to call deep throat . " .
his disclosure ended a mystery that had intrigued washington insiders and journalists for three decades and provided the grist for many hotly debated newspaper and magazine articles .
while felt 's name was raised as a suspect on several occasions , he always managed to deflect attention , usually by saying that if had been deep throat he would have done a better job of exposing the wrongdoings at the white house .
his disclosure in a vanity fair article by his family 's lawyer , john d. o'connor , provoked a national debate .
was he a hero who should be lauded for sparing the country the strain of further high crimes and misdemeanors by the nixon white house ?
or was he a traitor who betrayed not only his president but his oath of office by disclosing grand jury information and the contents of fbi files ?
for the most part , reaction split along political lines .
" there 's nothing heroic about breaking faith with your people , " said commentator patrick j. buchanan , a former nixon speechwriter .
felt " disgraced himself and dishonored everything an fbi agent should stand for . " .
but richard ben-veniste , a key lawyer in the watergate prosecution team , said felt 's role showed that " the importance of whistle-blowers should n't be underestimated , particularly when there are excesses by the executive branch of government -- which in this case went all the way to the executive office . " .
