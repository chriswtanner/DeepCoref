bettie page , the raven-haired pin-up whose naughty-but-nice romps with whips , garters and high heels titillated a generation of young men in the post-war years , has died at the age of 85 after suffering a heart attack earlier this month and slipping into a coma .
her career , which some claim laid the foundations for the sexual revolution that swept america in the 1960s , started almost by accident after she discovered that posing for amateur photographers in provocative poses and risque attire made her more money than secretarial work .
ms page 's fame was set after she was adopted by irving klaw and his sister , paula , in 1951 .
the couple ran a manhattan mail order business offering dirty pictures .
later , she was featured by playboy as a centrefold , including a 1955 image of her winking under a santa hat .
" bettie was one of the magazine 's early playmates , and became an iconic figure , influencing notions of beauty and fashion , " hugh hefner , the magazine 's founder , said on hearing of her death .
" her passing is very sad . " .
ms page disappeared for decades at the end of the fifties , suffering serial broken marriages and devoting herself to christianity .
even in her twilight years she suffered bouts of depression and ill health but was rediscovered in the late nineteen eighties .
she would occasionally make public appearances to sign photographs of herself as popular interest in her suddenly took off again .
to her astonishment , ms page has recently attained cult status .
madonna , uma thurman and demi moore are among contemporary stars who have at some time adopted bettie page poses , while in 2006 a movie , the notorious bettie page , featured gretchen mol in the title role .
ms page had been admitted to hospital originally for treatment for pneumonia and was set to be released and sent home on 2 december when she suffered her heart attack .
a representative said she never recovered consciousness and died late on thursday .
" she captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality , " her agent , mark roesler , said yesterday .
" she is the embodiment of beauty . " .
even though she conceded to the occasional public event , she never agreed to having her photograph taken again .
" i do n't want to be photographed in my old age , " she said in 1998 .
" i feel the same way with old movie stars .
it makes me sad .
we want to remember them when they were young . " .
after her early career peaked , ms page became exhibit number one in a congressional hearing into so-called immoral activities in washington .
the controversy prompted her disappearance from public view .
it was while living in florida that she had her born-again experience and committed herself to the church and to the ministry of the rev billy graham .
in her later years , she defended the trade she pioneered .
" i never thought it was shameful .
i felt normal .
it was better than pounding a typewriter eight hours a day , which gets monotonous , " she told playboy in 1998 .
as for being featured undressed , that seemed fine too .
" god approves of nudity , " she said .
" adam and eve in the garden of eden , they were naked as jaybirds . " .
