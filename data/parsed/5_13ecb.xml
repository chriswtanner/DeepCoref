philadelphia 76ers management had enough of the nba team lurking near the bottom of the eastern conference standings and fired head coach maurice cheeks on saturday .
assistant general manager tony dileo was named interim coach .
" decisions of this nature are never easy , and this was particularly difficult due to the great amount of respect i have for maurice cheeks , " team president and general manager ed stefanski said .
" however , at this time i felt that it is in the best interest of this team to make a change while there is still time to accomplish the goals we set forth for ourselves at the start of the season . " .
the 76ers dropped their third game in a row on friday , an 88-72 setback to cleveland , and occupy last place in the atlantic division with a 9-14 record .
cheeks would become the fifth nba coach fired this season , along with p.j. carlesimo ( oklahoma city ) , eddie jordan ( washington ) , sam mitchell ( toronto ) and randy wittman ( minnesota ) .
the former 76ers point guard for much of the 1980s came back to the city to assume coaching duties prior to the 2005 season .
last season he led the club to their first postseason berth in four years .
cheeks has an overall record of 284-286 , which includes nearly four years as coach of portland .
stefanski had given cheeks two contract extensions in the past season , but the slow start was enough to cost him his job .
the sixers have hardly resembled last season 's up-tempo group that advanced to the playoffs , despite the addition of free agent elton brand .
dileo has spent 19 seasons with the 76ers and was promoted to senior vice president and assistant general manager in 2003 .
prior to joining the organization he had amateur coaching experience .
philadelphia host the washington wizards on saturday .
