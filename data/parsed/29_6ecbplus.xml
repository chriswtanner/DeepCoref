colts beat chiefs 20 - 13 to clinch playoff berth .
dec . 24 4 : 33 am est .
andrew luck couldn't help but smile thinking about the joyous celebration taking place just down the hall , through the big metal doors marking the entrance to the colts' locker room .
even interim coach bruce arians had been dancing .
"it's a fun locker room , a great locker room , " luck said after leading indianapolis to a 20 - 13 victory over kansas city .
"you know guys are going to play hard no matter what the score , no matter what the situation , and i am very proud to be a part of a team like that . " .
a team that's headed back to the playoffs , too .
luck threw for 205 yards on sunday , breaking cam newton's single - season mark for yards by a first - year quarterback .
he also engineered the go - ahead drive late in the fourth quarter , hitting reggie wayne on third - and - goal from the kansas city 7 with just over 4 minutes remaining .
the touchdown pass finished off luck's seventh four - quarter comeback this season , and allowed the colts ( 10 - 5 ) to join the miami dolphins of 2008 as the only teams in nfl history to win at least 10 games one year after losing 14 or more .
"would we have done it without him ? " arians asked .
"no . " .
luck broke newton's record of 4 , 051 yards passing in the second quarter , and then became the fifth rookie quarterback in the super bowl era to win at least 10 games in a season .
"obviously it's nicer to be in the playoffs , " luck said , "but it's nice to have a couple records -- which i'm sure will be broken in the next year . " .
don't be quite so sure .
luck still has next sunday's game against houston to pile up numbers , and then comes a trip to the playoffs , where the colts became a mainstay under his predecessor , peyton manning .
"we didn't want to slide in the backdoor and put the extra stress on a man having to win the next game , " luck said .
"so we are very glad to be going to the postseason . " .
arians will also get a reprieve from shouldering so much of the burden .
colts coach chuck pagano , who has undergoing treatment for leukemia , plans to rejoin the team this week .
jamaal charles ran for 226 yards for the chiefs , including an 84 - yard scamper on the first play of the second half as his team rallied to forge a 13 - all tie entering the fourth quarter .
it was charles' second 200 - yard game of the season , and the third of his career , and came one week after he managed 10 yards on nine carries against oakland .
"it was fun today , competing out there and doing it while we were trying to come back , " charles said .
"it was fun going out there and putting out a performance like that . " .
charles joined the titans' chris johnson and former lions great barry sanders as the only players with three runs of 80 or more yards in a season .
peyton hillis added 101 yards on the ground for the chiefs ( 2 - 13 ) , who finished with 352 yards rushing in a losing effort .
a big reason why was brady quinn , who was just 10 of 22 for 162 yards with two interceptions through the air .
"this game was without a doubt , 100 percent on my shoulders , " quinn said .
"you can't play the way i played today and win a football game . " .
his trouble began with the chiefs' fifth offensive play , when he threw woefully behind dexter mccluster -- who wasn't even looking for the ball .
darius butler picked off the pass in stride , and took it untouched 32 yards to give the colts a 7 - 0 lead .
kansas city managed a field goal by ryan succop , but he missed his next try and the colts went the other direction to set up the first of adam vinatieri's two field goals .
charles fumbled in the red zone later in the second quarter , and the colts moved into vinatieri's range for a 36 - yard field goal and a 13 - 3 halftime lead .
charles electrified a sparse crowd on the first play of the second half .
he angled to the left and then found room down the sideline , cutting back toward the middle of the field and winning a foot - race with the indianapolis defense for an 86 - yard touchdown run .
the chiefs were in position to take the lead later in the third quarter , but quinn was picked off by vontae davis in the end zone .
the defense forced a three - and - out and kansas city was driving again before settling for succop's tying 47 - yard field goal .
the chiefs got the ball back again late in the fourth quarter , but quinn was stuffed on a quarterback sneak on fourth - and - inches from the indianapolis 27 .
that turned the ball over to luck , who completed an 11 - yard pass to t . y . hilton to convert a third down before he and wayne won it .
"at times it looked a little bleak , " arians said .
"guys hung in there , made plays when they had to make them .
offensively we struggled , and then put together a drive , like we have all year . " .
notes : chiefs wr terrance copper ( left knee ) and dt tyson jackson ( left foot ) left with injuries . . . .
wayne had five catches to become the fifth player in nfl history with four 100 - catch seasons .
he also became the 14th player to reach 13 , 000 yards receiving .
