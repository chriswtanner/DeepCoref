december 15th , 2008 , 7 : 35 am .
dan patrick reported on his show on am 570 that the boston red sox have made first baseman mark teixeira an eight - year , $200 million offer .
if so , that blows the reported eight - year , $160 million offers by the angels and the washington nationals out of the water .
patrick said monday morning : "if it's true they're offering $200 million to a career . 290 hitter , it'll be interesting to see what the angels do . " .
he then speculated the angels might turn their interest to manny ramirez .
the boston herald's michael silverman wrote in his monday column the red sox offer was expected to be in the range of $145 million to $175 million , possibly more .
he also noted that it is rare for boston to extend contracts to players that go to their 36th birthdays , with the exceptions of jason varitek's just - expired deal and mike lowell's contract .
teixeira will be 29 in april .
