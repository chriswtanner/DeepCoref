similar to the other macbook models , the trackpad has been updated to incorporate apple 's new multi-touch gestures and buttonless design .
the new 17 " macbook pro will come in one default configuration with a msrp of $ 2,799 , however , users will be able to upgrade their notebook with apple 's built-to-order program .
optional upgrades include a 8gbs of ddr3 memory , a 320gb hard drive , a 128gb or 256gb solid state drive , and various display output alternatives .
