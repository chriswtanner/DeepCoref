in front of his home fans and a national television audience , tyler hansbrough became the all-time leading scorer for north carolina basketball on thursday in his team 's win over evansville .
hansbrough needed just nine points in the game to eclipse phil ford for the top spot .
he wound up with 20 after surpassing ford 's mark in the first half .
hansbrough now has 2,301 career points as a tar heel .
hansbrough epitomizes all that is right with college basketball .
he gives his best every night , plays the game right , and has stayed in school for all four years of eligibility .
amid much speculation about how he will fare in the nba , hansbrough has remained focused on the present and is one of the biggest parts of the top team in the country , on what many believe is the best team in recent memory .
unc is now 10-0 , with their closest margin of victory being by 15 points .
joining events such as the big ten/acc challenge and the big 12/pac 10 hard-court series , the sec and big east showcased four cross-conference games for the second straight season .
while the sec stole the show on tuesday with victories from vanderbilt and tennessee , the big east responded on thursday with wins from cincinnati and louisville .
cincinnati jumped out to a big 18-point halftime lead over mississippi state , and fended off a comeback to win 75-63 .
the other game was very similar , as louisville jumped out to a big lead on mississippi .
mississippi came all the way back to tie the game in the second half before louisville ultimately won 77-68 .
mississippi was playing amid some controversy , as head coach andy kennedy denied charges of physical assault and racial remarks toward a cab driver .
several other players had big nights on thursday in addition to the record-setting night from hansbrough .
louisville 's earl clark finished his team 's victory with 25 points and 16 rebounds , both career highs .
clark actually had 17 points in just over the first eight minutes of the game , accounting for 17 of his team 's first 24 points .

cincinnati was led by deonta vaughn .
vaughn finished with 16 points and nine rebounds , scoring 14 in a four-minute stretch that resulted in a 20-2 run to close the half .
despite evanville 's loss to unc , one of their players was able to top hansbrough in the scoring column .
shy ely put up 23 points against the tar heels .
ely is a senior hoping to help lead the purple aces to the top of the missouri valley conference this season .
western kentucky , the same team that has given louisville its only loss of the season , earned a huge victory in their first conference game of the season by winning on the road against south alabama .
western kentucky and south alabama have dominated the sun belt conference in recent years , and both made the ncaa tournament last season .
the hilltoppers were led by 20-point efforts from guards a.j. slaughter and orlando mendez-valdez .
three teams went into games on thursday night trying to earn their first victories of the season .
congratulations are in order for north florida , who beat furman 77-66 .
the other two teams were not as fortunate .
