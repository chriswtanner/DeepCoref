colts beat chiefs 20 - 13 to clinch playoff berth .
december 23 , 2012 6 : 11 pm .
the expectations placed upon andrew luck almost seemed unfair .
being the heir to peyton manning in indianapolis is heady stuff for a rookie taking the reins of a franchise that won two games last season .
now , after guiding the colts back to the playoffs - and breaking cam newton's single - season passing record for a first - year player - it's safe to say luck exceeded just about all of them .
luck threw for 205 yards sunday , and his 7 - yard touchdown pass to reggie wayne on third - and - goal late in the fourth quarter gave the colts a 20 - 13 victory over the kansas city chiefs .
that put them into the playoffs without worrying about anybody else .
"would we have done it without him ? " colts interim coach bruce arians asked .
"no . " .
luck broke newton's record of 4 , 051 yards passing in the second quarter .
but it was extending his own rookie record for fourth - quarter comebacks to seven was more important .
the chiefs had rallied behind jamaal charles' 226 yards rushing to tie the game 13 - 13 heading into the fourth quarter .
the colts' defense stuffed quarterback brady quinn on fourth - and - inches to give luck a chance .
that's all he needed .
after a miserable stretch in which he connected on 1 of 13 passes , the fabulous freshman calmly led indianapolis ( 10 - 5 ) downfield .
he completed a key pass to t . y . hilton on third down and made two nice throws to wayne before hitting the veteran in the back of the end zone .
"we had so many opportunities all game , especially on third down , that we squandered , " wayne said .
"we wanted to get that done .
that was the opportune time to do it . " .
darius butler returned an interception 32 yards for the colts' other touchdown , helping them join the 2008 miami dolphins as the only teams to win at least 10 games after losing 14 or more the previous season .
most of those wins have come under arians , who has filled in admirably while chuck pagano underwent treatment for leukemia .
pagano is expected to rejoin the colts this week .
"mission accomplished .
that's all i can say , " arians said .
"without getting emotional again , knowing that ( pagano ) is going to be back monday , the work week shouldn't be as stressful . " .
charles' big day included an 86 - yard touchdown run on the first play of the second half .
it was his second 200 - yard game of the season , and came one week after he managed 10 yards on nine carries against oakland .
"it was fun today , competing out there and doing it while we were trying to come back , " charles said .
"it was fun going out there and putting out a performance like that . " .
charles joined the titans' chris johnson and former lions great barry sanders as the only players with three runs of 80 or more yards in a season .
his third career 200 - yard game also set a franchise record , which he had shared with larry johnson .
peyton hillis added 101 yards on the ground for the chiefs ( 2 - 13 ) , who had 352 yards rushing in a losing effort - the first time that's happened in nfl history .
a big reason why was quinn , who was just 10 of 22 for 162 yards with two interceptions .
"this game was without a doubt , 100 percent on my shoulders , " he said .
"you can't play the way i played today and win a football game . " .
his trouble began with the chiefs' fifth offensive play , when he threw woefully behind dexter mccluster - who wasn't even looking for the ball .
butler picked off the pass in stride , taking it untouched to the end zone for a 7 - 0 lead .
kansas city managed a field goal by ryan succop , but he missed his next try and the colts went the other direction to set up the first of adam vinatieri's two field goals .
charles fumbled in the red zone later in the second quarter , and the colts moved into vinatieri's range for a 36 - yard field goal and a 13 - 3 halftime lead .
charles electrified a sparse crowd on the first play of the second half .
he angled to the left and then found room down the sideline , cutting back toward the middle of the field and winning a foot - race with the indianapolis defense for an 86 - yard touchdown run .
the chiefs were in position to take the lead later in the third quarter , but quinn was picked off by vontae davis in the end zone .
the defense forced a three - and - out and kansas city was driving again before settling for succop's tying 47 - yard field goal .
the chiefs got the ball back again late in the fourth quarter , but quinn was stuffed on a quarterback sneak on fourth - and - inches from the indianapolis 27 .
that turned the ball over to luck , who completed an 11 - yard pass to t . y . hilton to convert a third down before he and wayne won it .
"at times it looked a little bleak , " arians said .
"guys hung in there , made plays when they had to make them .
offensively we struggled , and then put together a drive , like we have all year . " .
notes : chiefs wr terrance copper ( left knee ) and dt tyson jackson ( left foot ) left with injuries . . . .
wayne had five catches to become the fifth player in nfl history with four 100 - catch seasons .
he also became the 14th player to reach 13 , 000 yards receiving .
