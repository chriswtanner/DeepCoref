dr . regina benjamin : nominee for surgeon general .
july 13 , 2009 12 : 49 pm edt .
the president announced his nominee for the u . s . surgeon general , dr . regina benjamin , today at the white house .
dr . benjamin has an extensive and distinguished career in medicine .
she is the founder and ceo of the bayou la batre rural health clinic in alabama , which aims to provide primary care to people of any age regardless of their financial situation .
she previously served as chair of the federation of state medical boards of the united states , and as the associate dean for rural health at the university of south alabama college of medicine .
additionally , she was chosen as president of the medical association of alabama in 2002 , becoming the first african - american woman to be president of a state medical society .
she was also the first african - american woman and physician under 40 to be elected to the american medical association board of trustees .
she received the nelson mandela award for health and human rights in 1998 , among other honors .
the president emphasized this experience in his remarks , chronicling her dedication to providing health care for her rural community in the face of adversity .
and that's why , even though she could have left the state to make more money as a specialist or as a doctor in a wealthier community , regina benjamin returned to alabama and opened a small clinic in bayou la batre .
when people couldn't pay , she didn't charge them .
when the clinic wasn't making money , she didn't take a salary for herself .
when hurricane george destroyed the clinic in 1998 , she made house calls to all her patients while it was rebuilt .
when hurricane katrina destroyed it again and left most of her town homeless , she mortgaged her house and maxed out her credit cards to rebuild that clinic for a second time .
she tended to those who had been wounded in the storm , and when folks needed medicine , she asked the pharmacist to send the bill her way .
and when regina's clinic was about to open for the third time , and a fire burned it to the ground before it could serve the first patient , well , you can guess what dr . benjamin did .
with help from her community , she is rebuilding it again .
one disabled patient brought her an envelope with $20 inside .
another elderly man said simply , "maybe i can help .
i got a hammer . " .
for nearly two decades , dr . regina benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is broken about our health care system .
she's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive .
she's been a relentless promoter of prevention and wellness programs , having treated too many costly and - - diseases and complications that didn't have to happen .
and she's witnessed the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural and underserved areas where she works .
but for all that she's seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome , regina benjamin also represents what's best about health care in america - - doctors and nurses who give and care and sacrifice for the sake of their patients ; those americans who would do anything to heal a fellow citizen .
as the president explained , through this personal experience working with the poor and uninsured , dr . benjamin understands firsthand the urgent need for health care reform .
as surgeon general , she will be the people's health advocate , and will play a key role in health care reform .
in her remarks , dr . benjamin explained how she sees her role .
my hope , if confirmed as surgeon general , is to be america's doctor , america's family physician .
as we work toward a solution to this health care crisis , i promise to communicate directly with the american people to help guide them through whatever changes may come with health care reform .
