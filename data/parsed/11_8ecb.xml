turkmenistan 's voters are going to the polls in parliamentary elections portrayed by the government as a step towards democracy in the gas-rich central asian nation .
but critics say that sunday 's vote is a sham with all the candidates either representing the ruling democratic party , the only registered party , or a handful of state-approved independents .
" beyond all the pompous declarations , there will be no real change , " tadzhigul begmedova , director of the turkmenistan helsinki foundation for human rights , said from bulgaria .
" the hopes many people had that a new president would open up turkmen society have been shattered . " .
gurbanguli berdymukhamedov became president in 2006 after the death of saparmurat niyazov , who forged a personality cult that saw months of the year renamed after himself and his mother , and a spiritual guide he authored become mandatory for students and government workers .
'pluralism and openess ' .
berdymukhamedov rolled back some of the decrees which had celebrated the previous leader and vowed to increase democracy and foreign investment .
" it does not matter who gets elected .
the president has the final say " .
" this campaign stands out for its pluralism , openness and the activeness of the citizens , " an election official told the afp news agency , requesting anonymity .
in september , the people 's council , a 2,507-member assembly of presidential appointees , town elders and others , voted to abolish itself and cede most of its powers to an expanded parliament .
but more than half of the 288 candidates running for the parliament 's 125 seats on sunday are from the democratic party , while the others have been drawn from state-controlled women 's and veterans ' organisations , trade unions and a youth group .
all of them receive state funding for the campaign as no other form of political funding is allowed under turkmenistan 's laws .
" it does not matter who gets elected .
the president has the final say , " osman-aga , who herds camels in a remote desert area , told the reuters news agency .
contest 'impossible ' .
the organisation for security and co-operation in europe has not sent only three observers to monitor the vote , saying a genuine contest was impossible .
human rights watch said in a report last month .
" the conditions are not in place to hold a free and fair election that would be a meaningful reflection of the will of the people . " .
the presence of foreign media also is limited as many journalists were unable to get permission to report there .
the run-up to the election in the former soviet state has seen little campaigning and garnered little coverage on state-run television .
" there are very few billboards around the city ... .
i still do n't know who i 'm supposed to vote for , " maral , a resident of ashgabat who declined to give her surname for fear of official intimidation , told the associated press news agency .
