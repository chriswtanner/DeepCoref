warren jeffs trial : defends 'spiritual' marriage , polygamy .
july 29 , 2011|10 : 57 pm .
warren jeffs , leader of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints , who has been silent since his trial began last thursday , spoke for the first time with the jury present friday .
jeffs is charged with two counts of sexual assault for raping two under - aged girls and fathering a child with one of the girls .
objecting to the testimony from an fbi agent about documents seized from his church's compound in 2008 , jeffs delivered a 55 - minute speech arguing that the raid on the church was illegal and that charges brought upon him and other members of the flds were unwarranted .
"you are now touching that which is sacred .
thus on these grounds we call upon this court to render justice before sacred trust is trampled upon , " jeffs said during his objection .
during the raid of the yearning for zion ranch , executed after a tip that turned out to be a hoax , police witnessed several underage girls who were heavily pregnant .
this led to the arrest of jeffs as well as 11 other men of the flsd .
thus far , seven men have been tried and convicted of sexual assault and bigamy , among other crimes , and have received sentences of between six and 75 years .
jeffs himself may receive up to 119 - years in prison if convicted .
in his testimony on friday , jeffs said there was no crime , explaining that he and both girls had a "spiritual" marriage bond .
he went on to say that the flds must "follow the law set out for it by god . " .
"if we do not live these laws we are damned here and hereafter .
we believe in a marriage system of eternity called celestial marriage , wherein celestial means heavenly authorized , not to be intervened by government intervention , " jeffs said .
jeffs ended his speech by saying , "amen . " .
jeffs remained completely silent during the first four days of the trial , during which he dismissed his defense team in order to serve as his own defense , and refused to give an opening statement after the judge declined his request for more time to prepare .
"mr . jeffs , the court is not going to recess these proceeding to let you go to law school , " said u . s . district judge barbara walther .
in the meanwhile , special prosecutor for the texas attorney general's office , eric nichols , delivered his opening statement , detailing that he will submit as evidence an audio recording of jeffs having sex with a 12 - year - old as well as a dna report confirming jeffs as the father of a 15 - year - old flsd member's child .
jeffs remained silent throughout the prosecution's opening statement but interjected repeatedly during nichol's response to his speech .
judge walther recessed the court and directed that jeffs speak with his counsel , who remains available in case they are needed , about proper court decorum .
director of criminal clinics for the texas tech school of law , patrick metze , commented on the case , saying jeffs won't be able to continue the trial without lawyers .
"at some point , the judge will have had enough , so it's not going to be a pleasnt experience and she's not just going to let him prophesize , " metze told the san angelo standard times .
