apple 's big announcement at macworld yesterday was not a new imac , mini or netbook , all of which had been rumoured , but a battery .
the firm announced a widely expected refresh of its 17in macbook pro , with a battery that the firm said will offer eight hours of operation , but which is not removable from the case .
the battery , based on conventional lithium polymer technology commonly found in laptops and mobile phones , has been integrated into the case to make the device thinner while increasing battery life , according to apple senior vice president of marketing phil schiller .
apple has also introduced a separate chip that monitors the power used by each cell and adjusts the charging current accordingly , which the firm says extends the life of the battery .
the macworld crowd did not let out its characteristic whoops of excitement when schiller announced the battery , even when he said that its capacity for 1,000 full recharges - three times the average achieved by other notebooks - would give the average battery a five-year life .
however , one mac customer from the show floor was sceptical of the claims .
" apple says five years , but for some it might only be two or three , " he said .
" look at the way guys like us travel . " .
apple will offer a p135 take-back and replacement service for the battery .
the keynote was decidedly low-key this year , being apple 's last following a decision to pull out from the idg-run show .
other than the macbook pro , the company concentrated on enhancements to its iwork package , including a beta version of iwork.com .
the service lets users share iwork files , including those in microsoft office format , and to comment on each other 's work .
glaringly absent at macworld were refreshes of the now ageing mac mini and the imac desktop lines .
