apple unveils cheaper ivy bridge - powered macbook air .
june 12 , 2012 .
apple has chosen wwdc week to announce an update to its macbook air line .
it may lack the retina display of its newly upgraded , headline - grabbing cousin , the macbook pro , but the 2012 air sees significant advances too .
an upgrade from sandy bridge to ivy bridge processors with improved integrated graphics is chief among the upgrades , and onboard memory has also received a boost .
what hasn't changed is the ultra - thin form factor and ( with the thick end of the wedge maxing out at 0 . 68 in or 17 mm ) , weighing in at 2 . 38 pounds ( 1 . 08 kg ) for the 11 - inch model and 2 . 96 pounds ( 1 . 35 kg ) for the 13 - inch .
battery performance remains as is ( which is no bad thing ) , with a touted 5 and 7 hours for the smaller and larger models respectively while wirelessly browsing the web .
what's new is an upgrade from sandy bridge to the faster ivy bridge processor , which brings with it a switch up from intel hd graphics 3000 to intel hd graphics 4000 .
this should bring with it a noticeable performance boost , though its doubtful that hardcore gamers will be rushing to buy the new airs as portable gaming rigs this year .
the included random access memory allowance has doubled from 2 to 4 gb ( configurable to 8 gb ) , and has been upgraded to lower voltage 1600 - mhz ddr3l sdram .
flash storage remains at 64 gb and 128 gb in the entry - level 11 - and 13 - inch models respectively , though this is now configurable up to 512 gb .
connectivity sees a significant boost with the inclusion of two usb 3 . 0 ports in addition to the thunderbolt port .
the usb 3 . 0 standard allows data transfer more than ten times the speed of usb 2 . 0 .
the power connection has been upgraded to apple's magsafe 2 , which is simply an even smaller version of the magsafe port that lets the power cable disconnected safely in the event of jarring cable snag , preventing unwelcome macbook / floor interface scenarios .
though the 11 - inch air still starts at us$999 , the 13 - inch has dropped $100 to $1199 , making it all the more compelling to laptop - hunters on the prowl for an ultrabook .
