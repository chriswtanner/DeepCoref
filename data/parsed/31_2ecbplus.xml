ott " s thoughts : creighton returns to mvc semis with win over drake .
posted on march 09 , 2013 .
the roar .
my goodness , the roar .
take approximately 7 , 000 creighton hoops fans .
ply them with a cocktail or two .
heap a few heavy dashes of high expectations for the weekend , and shake it all up with one big sense of being on vacation .
that concoction looks like a blue - out in the scottrade center .
it sounds like an overwhelming tidal wave of blue - clad crazies crashing onto the hard court after every doug mcdermott make and terrible officiating call .
creighton fans overtook the turnstiles in st . louis friday afternoon .
they came from all over the midwest and beyond to see cu win the weekend , and the bluejays obliged the first of three requisite wins for an arch madness championship .
drake put up a fight ; the bulldogs twice cut creighton " s lead to 3 points midway through the second half .
but a 15 - 2 run during 5 minutes late in the game sealed the deal for the jays , who will meet indiana state in the semifinals saturday afternoon after the sycamores outlasted evansville 51 - 50 friday .
creighton " s win over drake was historic for a few reasons , chief among them mcdermott setting the creighton career scoring record .
mcdermott scored 10 of the team " s first 17 points , displaying a mix of three - point touch and the ability to finish around the rim .
you know , classic dougie fresh .
those 10 points tied mcdermott with rodney buford , creighton " s all - time leading scorer .
and as those of us in the crowd who paid attention to such things held off on a bathroom or beer trip to watch him score one more point to break the record , mcdermott wouldn " t do so for another 8 minutes of game time .
still , it was inevitable .
and a bit anticlimactic , frankly , when he toed the free throw line and set the record with a one - for - two trip to the charity stripe .
still , that mcdermott broke rodzilla " s record in just three seasons is wild to me .
i " m lucky to say i " ve been able to watch mcdermott , buford , bob harstad , and chad gallagher -- the school " s top four scorers in history -- during my time on earth cheering for the jays .
but had you told me after that ncaa tournament game in 1999 that buford " s record would be bested by a guy in only three seasons , i " d have called you nuts .
or , as the kids around the valley type on twitter right now , #nutz .
as for the entirety of his afternoon , mcdermott was usual dependable doug .
with a building full of nba scouts hanging on his moves ( and , later , on illinois state " s jackie carmichael " s ridiculous individual performance ) , mcdermott scored 23 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in 35 minutes .
he left the court to chants of " one more year ! one more year ! one more year ! " .
indeed .
but for all of mcdermott " s historic accomplishments and his game - high scoring output , the storyline from the cu side of things was the combined play of gregory echenique and will artino .
echenique hadn " t scored much in two games against drake earlier this season : he put up just 2 points in a 30 - point cu win in omaha , and then battled foul trouble all night in des moines as drake upset cu .
and he went scoreless in the first half friday .
but up stepped artino , echenique " s sub when the cu coaching staff goes in favor of size and a high / low game instead of ethan wragge " s shooting touch from deep .
friday afternoon , artino gave the bluejays 14 energized and efficient minutes .
entering february , he had played double - digit minutes in just six games .
since the calendar flipped from january , though , he " s had five such games .
friday was arguably his most important performance of the season , given the stakes .
artino checked in at the under - 16 : 00 media timeout and immediately broke a 12 - 12 tie with a dunk .
fouled on the flush , he finished the traditional three - point play with a free throw .
two trips later , artino missed a shot but secured the follow and scored again .
he would grab two more rebounds before checking out with 9 : 07 to play in the first half .
while he was in , creighton " s lead grew as great as 9 points .
in 8 first - half minutes , the guy teammates and fans call big swag scored 7 points and ripped down 5 rebounds .
he played the high - low possessions well .
while drake held echenique scoreless in the first half , artino was able to find success .
he finished the day with a career - high 14 points and 6 rebounds ( 5 on the offensive glass ) .
in the second half , though , echenique got , um , engaged with things .
he scored all 11 of his points , grabbed 6 of his team - high 11 rebounds , and swatted 5 of his season - high 6 blocked shots ( the 6 blocks are second - most in an mvc tournament game ) .
during the game " s deciding 15 - 2 run , echenique scored two traditional three - point plays , grabbed 3 of his 11 rebounds , and blocked two shots .
hammered on a no - call and forced to play at a disadvantage based on inconsistent referring in the frontcourt , echenique seemed fired up .
he flexed a few times , too , so as to remind the bulldogs who the alpha dog in the paint was on friday afternoon .
the tournament " s top seed sticks around for semifinal saturday .
the 1998 bradley braves remains the only play - in winner to advance past the quarterfinals , when they beat a two - seeded creighton team .
wichita state survived a close game against missouri state friday evening , and illinois state broke away late from northern iowa to advance as the six - seed .
the valley will have four solid fan bases represented in the scottrade center saturday afternoon , with white and blue and black and gold the predominant colors swirling around the lower bowl .
the day sets up for some solid matchups .
the last time the two teams played , indiana state made creighton look completely lost .
a blacked out crowd in terre haute helped the sycamores to a resounding win .
meanwhile , it took a carmichael karate kick and other late - game miscues for illinois state to practically hand over a win to wichita state in normal .
