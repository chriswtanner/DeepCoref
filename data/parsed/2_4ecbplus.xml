she will make her second appearance as the show's emcee on the march 2 broadcast .
ellen degeneres will host this year's oscars .
degeneres herself announced the news friday morning on twitter , writing , "it's official : i'm hosting the #oscars !
i'd like to thank @theacademy , my wife portia and , oh dear , there goes the orchestra . " .
choosing degeneres , known for her kindler , gentler humor , signals that the academy's next awards show will have a decidedly different tone than the 85th academy awards , hosted by seth macfarlane , who drew criticism for routines like his song about actresses' nudity on film .
degeneres previously hosted the show in 2007 and earned a primetime emmy nomination for her work .
"i am so excited to be hosting the oscars for the second time .
you know what they say - - the third time's the charm , " degeneres said in a statement .
zadan and meron added : "we are thrilled to have ellen degeneres host the oscars . " .
newly elected academy president boone isaacs said , "i agreed with craig and neil immediately that ellen is the ideal host for this year's show . " .
meanwhile , abc entertainment group president paul lee said , "it is an honor to welcome back ellen degeneres as the host of the biggest entertainment celebration of the year . " .
