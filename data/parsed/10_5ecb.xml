super-agent scott boras said leaving the winter meetings that it was going to take an eight-year deal to get the services of slugging first-baseman mark teixeira .
the angels apparently are good with that .
los angeles general manager tony reagins has sounded like a broken record saying that resigning teixeira was his top priority , and backed that up now with an eight-year offer .
no dollar figures have been released with the offer , but the seven-year offers for teixeira were in the $ 140 million to $ 160 million range and the new offer is expected to be at the top of that range .
if accepted , this would certainly be the largest contract in the angels history , dwarfing the four-year , $ 90 million deal that torii hunter got just last summer .
but if he keeps mashing like he did after the trade , teixeira could be worth the bank .
in 54 games with the angeles he hit .358 with 13 home runs and 43 rbis , and had a slugging percentage of .632 .
the two-time gold glove winner also helped solidify the angeles infield .
after the winter meetings , the conventional wisdom was that the red sox were the frontrunners for teixeira 's services , even though they met privately and their offer was never made public ( maybe that 's why people thought they were the leaders ) .
however , no other offer ( including from the nationals and oriels trying to bring teixeira back to his native maryland ) was thought to be more than seven years .
the race for teixeira seems to be in the final furlong .
but then again , boras is a patient man , especially if he thinks more money could be around the corner .
