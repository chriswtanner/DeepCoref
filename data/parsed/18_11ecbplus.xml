a man suspected of shooting three people , killing one , at a suburban detroit accounting firm from which he was fired last week was arrested after a high - speed chase a few hours after the attack this morning , authorities said .
police said they had located anthony lacalamita , 38 , on the interstate 75 highway , north of the office building where the shootings took place .
sheriff's deputies and state police chased him for 48km , including through a construction zone , at speeds up to 193km / h before he finally pulled over after about 15 minutes , genesee county sheriff robert j pickell said .
"he probably realised if he didn't , he was going to be shot , " undersheriff james gage said .
lacalamita said nothing after officers surrounded him , pickell said , describing the suspect as "subdued .
very , very , very subdued" .
officers found a 12 - gauge pump - action shotgun and three live shells in the vehicle , pickell said .
witnesses said the shooter used a shotgun or a rifle , troy police lieutenant gerry scherlinck said .
some witnesses told police that when the shooter walked into the office on the building's second floor at about 10am today , he looked as if he was trying to hide something , troy police chief charles craft said .
police could not say how many shots were fired .
"i'm not positive all three of the people were targeted , but there appeared to be some purpose , " craft said .
the families of the two wounded men requested "total privacy" , and the hospital would not release any details about their conditions , beaumont hospital spokeswoman ilene wolfe said .
she said the third victim died on the way to the hospital .
lacalamita was listed among the professional staff on the website of gordon advisers , a public accounting and business consulting firm in the building .
calls to gordon advisers were not answered this afternoon , and a recording said the offices were closed .
the 15 , 800 - square - metre building houses a number of businesses , including law offices and the accounting firm .
police at first told workers to stay in their offices but a short time later evacuated the building , about 24km north of detroit .
bill adgate , who works at lpl financial inside the building , said he had hunkered down inside the office for a couple of hours with furniture pushed up against the door .
he said police told the group to stay put until officers allowed them to leave .
"it's tough .
i want to get out , " adgate said by telephone .
