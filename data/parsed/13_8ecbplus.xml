fire destroys historic mat maid dairy building in palmer .
published : august 7 , 2012 .
warehouse was one of the last original buildings remaining from the matanuska colony .
the matanuska maid block building , one of the oldest buildings in palmer , burned to the ground in a spectacular fire tuesday morning .
the wooden structure at 325 e . dahlia ave . was known as the "old mat maid warehouse . " .
it was built in 1935 , the same year that the first farm families arrived as part of the federal government's matanuska colony project .
a 911 caller reported the fire at 3 : 33 a . m .
palmer fire and rescue chief john mcnutt arrived and saw fire under the eaves of the building .
"within one minute or two , the whole roof was ablaze , " said palmer public safety director jon owen .
after a quick survey of the scene , owen said , mcnutt's main concern was keeping the fire from spreading to the heating oil stored next door at the crowley fuel distribution center .
the mat - su central fire department joined palmer firefighters with men and equipment .
photos show the entire two - story building seeming to go up in flames at once , with a ball of fire boiling into the air 20 feet above the roof .
owen said a total of 31 fire trucks , emergency vehicles and other equipment were eventually on scene .
three "aerials , " ladders with hoses , fought the fire from above , two of which were positioned between the fire and crowley .
at its height , 5 , 000 gallons of water were being poured onto the blaze every minute .
"it was a testament to the palmer water system , " owen said .
"we could have had a ( larger ) conflagration . " .
a crowley employee was at the office within minutes , said terminal manager jasper hall , ready to move the fuel delivery trucks out of harm's way .
the terminal mainly holds heating oil , he said .
by 6 : 40 a . m . the fire was under control , owen said .
by noon , small clouds of smoke still rose from the pile of ash and a few charred upright timbers teetered over the ruin .
the building , which the city of palmer had valued at about $380 , 600 , was a total loss .
anchorage lawyer william ingaldson , the building's owner , was there to inspect the damage .
he said he had owned the property for six or seven years .
he estimated the size of the structure at 12 , 000 square feet .
"none of it was insured , " he said .
"i'm assuming it's arson or vandalism . " .
there were no reports of injuries .
the building was vacant and not in use at the time of the fire .
the structure made the alaska association for historic preservation's list of 10 most endangered properties in the state for the past four years .
it was also known as the colony project warehouse because it was built as part of the federal matanuska colony project during the new deal era .
families were brought to palmer and given land .
they formed the matanuska valley farmers cooperating association .
the warehouse stored feed and other supplies for the farmers .
the matanuska colony had a mixed record .
within five years , half of the settlers gave up and left .
but dairy operations proved successful .
at a time when shipment of food from the states could take a month , valley producers supplied fresh milk to customers along the rail belt .
the co - op became the matanuska maid corporation .
in the 1950s , dairy operators fought a losing battle against the importation of reconstituted milk , which allowed powdered milk to be mixed with fresh milk and sold at a lower price .
as transportation improved , it became cheaper to ship milk from the lower 48 .
the state's point mackenzie project , designed to rescue alaska's dairy industry , turned out to be a colossal failure .
mat maid filed for bankruptcy in november 1983 .
the state took over and ran the business until economic pressures forced it to close in december 2007 .
even before then , mat maid assets were being put on the auction block or abandoned .
the trading post , also built in 1935 , is beautifully restored and still open for business as dahlia street market , on the other side of the street .
but the matanuska maid creamery building , which stood between the street and the warehouse in the old days , was burned down by teenagers in 2003 .
grass and cottonwoods now cover the site .
the long warehouse boasted a full - length porch and distinctive chevron pattern at the gable ends of the roof .
it had its own railroad siding .
three cupolas drew light into the building .
a recessed entry let workers unload wagons or trucks out of the wind .
a historical marker reads , "these buildings were the heart and economic center of palmer and the colony . " .
the old warehouse was weathered and battered on the outside , ingaldson said .
"but inside , there was all this beautiful timber .
clear , old - growth fir .
not a knot in it .
cedar tongue - and - groove floors . " .
the building still stored relics from its glory days , he said , canvas potato bags and containers for cheese products .
ingaldson said he had explored different options for developing the building , which was not being used at the time of the fire .
ideas included turning it into apartments , shops and offices for nonprofit groups or as part of a convention area .
"there were lots of really good plans we had , " he said .
"it was a historic building with lots of possibilities .
you can't replace that .
"it's devastating . " .
the state fire marshall's office is helping investigate the fire .
palmer police ask anyone with information about how the fire started to call sgt . shayne la croix at 745 - 4811 .
