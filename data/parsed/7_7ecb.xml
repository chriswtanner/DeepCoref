wladimir klitschko easily set aside the challenge of substitute hasim rahman , stopping the former heavyweight champion in seven rounds on saturday in mannheim , germany .
klitschko ( 52-3 , 46 knockouts ) retained his international boxing federation title for the fifth time in the process .
the six-foot-five ukrainian-born champ was never threatened in the bout , controlling the distance with his jab and introducing some heavy right hands beginning late in the second round .
rahman , 36 , soon grew more intent on survival than winning and fell from three consecutive left hooks in the sixth .
referee tony weeks elected to stop the bout early in the seventh when the american was offering no reply to klitschko 's thudding blows .
rahman ( 45-7-2 , 36 kos ) fell into the title shot five weeks ago when unbeaten russian alexander povetkin suffered an ankle injury in training and could n't face klitschko .
the baltimore , md. , native held portions of heavyweight title on two previous occasions , but has n't beaten an elite opponent in several years .
he was undisputed champ for six months in 2001 after stunning lennox lewis by knockout in south africa .
lewis avenged the defeat later in that year with a one-punch knockout of his own .
rahman would go on to win the vacant world boxing council in 2005 over monte barrett but lost it just over a year later to oleg maskaev .
the win over rahman was the 32-year-old klitschko 's third of the year , following up a decision over sultan ibragimov and an 11th-round stoppage of tony thompson .
his older brother , vitali , now holds the wbc title .
