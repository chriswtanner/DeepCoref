residents evacuated from their homes after a huge fire at a waitrose store in banstead on friday night have been allowed to return to their homes .
around 60 people spent the evening at a local day care centre after being evacuated from their homes near the supermarket in the high street .
they were initially sent to banstead baptist church after the blaze broke out about 8.40pm .
police said they wanted to thank residents and local businesses for their patience and assistance during the evacuation .
the alarm was raised after a cctv operator noticed smoke coming from the roof of the store .
high winds meant the fire spread rapidly through the waitrose , which was almost totally destroyed .
other premises suffered some damage , such as smashed windows and smoke damage .
the fire was still burning on saturday morning .
investigators have since been sifting through the rubble to find the cause of the fire , which police have said they are treating as " potentially suspicious . " .
many nearby roads were cordoned off and police said on saturday they were likely to remain closed for some time .
anyone with any information about the fire is asked to contact surrey police on 0845 125 2222 or crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 .
