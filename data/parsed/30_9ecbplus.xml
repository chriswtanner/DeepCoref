mweb operations has issued an update regarding the seacom downtime to its customers .
"some more bandwidth was brought online last night [ 10 october 2011 ] bringing us up to 83% of our required capacity .
we allowed p2p traffic to run from midnight to 7am , after which it had to give way for critical traffic again . " .
"we are working on having the remaining capacity restored during the course of the day , after which all traffic priorities will return to normal , " said mweb operations .
seacom has previously issued a statement on the current problem with the cable .
"initial estimates indicate that the total repair time will be around twelve days depending on weather conditions .
this entails gaining the necessary permits and the actual repair time .
a repair vessel has been notified of the call - out and mobilization will occur immediately once permits are received , " seacom said in an official statement .
