mafia 'oddfather , ' vincent 'chin' gigante , dies in u . s . prison at 77 .
tuesday , december 20 , 2005 .
vincent "the chin" gigante , the powerful mob boss who avoided jail for decades by wandering the greenwich village streets in a ratty bathrobe and slippers as part of an elaborate feigned mental illness , died monday in prison , federal officials said .
he was 77 .
gigante died at the u . s . medical center for federal prisoners in springfield , mo . , said prison spokesman al quintero .
the cause of death was not immediately known , but quintero said gigante had a history of heart disease .
dubbed the "oddfather" for his bizarre behavior , the former genovese crime family head , an ex - boxer whose lengthy string of victories over prosecutors ended with a july 1997 racketeering conviction , finally admitted his insanity ruse at an april 2003 court hearing .
after nearly a quarter - century of public craziness , gigante calmly pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for his deception .
he then chatted amiably with his son , shook hands with defense lawyers and even laughed at one point .
"god bless you , " he told the judge , offering a broad wave goodbye before leaving the brooklyn courtroom .
gigante was jailed in the medical ward at the federal prison in springfield - the same facility where rival mob boss john gotti died .
denying he was a gangster , gigante would wander the streets of his native greenwich village in nightclothes , muttering incoherently .
relatives , including a brother was who a roman catholic priest , insisted gigante suffered from paranoid schizophrenia , dementia and alzheimer's disease .
authorities charged it was a brazen act to avoid the law - although it wasn't until 1997 that a jury agreed , and it took another six years for gigante to concede his subterfuge .
at the height of his power , gigante's empire stretched from the booths at little italy's san gennaro festival to the docks of miami .
"the looney tunes act served gigante well - it kept him out of prison for 30 years - but in the end he was the victim of his own crazy act .
he never had a chance to enjoy the fruits of his plunder , and he told some people that if given the chance , he wouldn't do it that way again , " said jerry capeci , a mafia expert and author of six books on organized crime .
for the man described by the new york times magazine as "the last great mafioso of the century , " his admission was the final act in a 50 - year career spanning the era of the old - time , publicity - shy "mustache petes" and the modern - day mafia of the swaggering gotti .
gigante looked the part , a stocky figure with a pugilist's face and 1940s brylcreem pompadour .
mob experts called him a traditional boss , trusted by others , who settled issues by whatever means - verbal or violent - were required .
his fall from power was sealed in a brooklyn courtroom where a parade of six turncoat mobsters , led by ex - gotti underboss salvatore "sammy the bull" gravano , described "chin's" power in the genovese clan and the "commission , " organized crime's ruling directorate .
the trial was a spectacle , with gigante in a wheelchair , mumbling silently , seemingly oblivious to the proceedings .
his lawyers claimed they could not communicate in any "meaningful way" with a client who didn't know where he was , or why .
at one point the trial turned into a "battle of the wheelchairs , " with testimony from peter chiodo , a 300 - plus - pound mobster who had survived a ganglaand execution only because his fat stopped a dozen bullets .
none of that swayed jurors , who convicted gigante of racketeering , extortion and plotting the murder - never carried out - of ex - mob associate peter savino .
"defendant has been consistently feigning insanity for many years and is still doing so in a shrewd attempt to avoid punishment for his crimes , " u . s . district judge jack b . weinstein said in sentencing gigante to 12 years in prison .
"he is a shadow of his former self - an old man finally brought to bay in his declining years after decades of vicious criminal tyranny . " .
the verdict was a major blow to a mafia already reeling from defections and convictions under the federal racketeering statute .
although gigante allegedly ran the family from prison , the genovese clan joined the city's four other mob families in disarray after he was jailed .
lawyer michael marinaccio , who led gigante's defense team , said monday that "putting aside the mental stuff , " gigante had suffered from "a multitude of medical issues relating to the heart , " and had undergone open heart surgery twice , in 1988 and 1996 .
recently when he complained of breathing difficulties , his family obtained a court order to have him treated at a hospital outside the prison until about two weeks ago , marinaccio said in a telephone interview .
"vincent was very frail , and i have to say the prison medical care was substandard , no matter where he was , " marinaccio said .
"the family is very close , they made regular visits , and i feel especially bad for them , " he added .
born in the bronx in 1928 , one of five sons of italian immigrant parents , gigante was nicknamed "chin" - short for "vincenzo" - by his mother .
he became a small - time boxer and drifted into the crime family founded in 1931 by legendary gangster charles "lucky" luciano .
in 1957 , gigante was the hitman in a botched attempt to assassinate then - boss frank costello .
after refusing to name his attacker in court , the shaken costello retired , making gigante's patron , vito genovese , kingpin of the family that still bears his name .
over time , gigante proved better at beating the law than gotti , the so - called "teflon don" who won two acquittals before tapes and turncoats sent him to prison for life .
prior to 1997 , gigante had served only a five - year heroin rap in 1959 .
as boss , gigante's watchword was secrecy .
a sign at his headquarters warned , "don't talk .
this place is bugged . " .
he held commission meetings in his mother's apartment house .
fellow mobsters , ordered never to say his name in public , referred to him by stroking their chins .
he also turned his claim of mental illness - first used to escape trial in a 1970 police - bribery case - into a full - time strategy , behaving weirdly in public , checking into psychiatric treatment clinics whenever the fbi turned up the heat .
there were comic - opera moments : once , agents serving a subpoena found gigante standing naked in the shower , holding an umbrella .
another time , upon spotting agents watching him , he fell to the sidewalk and prayed .
such maneuvers paid off .
in 1985 a federal crackdown on the commission indicted 12 top hoodlums - but not gigante , who some experts said was the actual leader .
yet even "chin's" ruses were not always airtight ; some mob cronies slipped up , and the fbi eventually obtained tapes of gigante acting normally in private .
later , prison psychologists also said he appeared rational at times .
gigante had eight children by his wife and a mistress , both named olympia .
relatives , led by rev . louis gigante , his priest - brother and most ardent defender , filled three rows at the 1997 trial .
louis gigante was in court when his brother finally admitted to faking his illness .
