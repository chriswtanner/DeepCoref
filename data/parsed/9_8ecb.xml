the bush administration on thursday eliminated 35-year-old regulations in the endangered species act that required an independent scientific review of proposed federal projects to determine whether they imperil protected plants and animals .
instead , federal agencies undertaking projects like road and power plant construction or oil and gas drilling will make their own assessment .
without the independent reviews , such projects could be accelerated .
as part of the changes announced by interior secretary dirk kempthorne in the final days of the bush administration , the department finalized an interim rule that allows oil and gas drilling in polar bear habitat off alaska 's coast .
the rule change is designed to prevent the endangered species act from being used to regulate greenhouse gas emissions , essentially making climate change policy .
kempthorne , who characterized the new rules as a common-sense streamlining of bureaucratic processes , acknowledged that there was disagreement within the department regarding the rules , which take effect in 30 days .
under current law , agencies must submit any plans that could harm species on the endangered list for review by scientists at the u.s. fish and wildlife service , which enforces the endangered species act .
the process has been criticized by home builders groups and the oil and gas industry for delaying costly projects .
the consultation requirement was intended as more than just a check and balance .
jamie rappaport clark , executive vice president of defenders of wildlife and director of fish and wildlife under president clinton , said the consultation process resolved the problem of " mission conflict " between agencies .
the department of defense , for example , might not understand why an endangered plant should be considered when expanding a bombing range .
" the problem is the agencies do n't always properly consider , understand or protect species in their habitat because they are focused on the pursuit of their primary mission , " clark said .
" it 's hard for the biologists to satisfy their responsibility to protect species if the agency perceives it affects their primary mission . " .
president-elect barack obama said he would reverse the rule changes , as have some members of congress .
but that requires a lengthy rule-making process .
in the house , members can invoke the rarely used congressional review act to overturn the regulations .
" these changes are going to result in more species being put in jeopardy , " clark said .
" but more importantly , we are not going to know what we do n't know anymore . " .
officials said agencies would still be held liable if they approved projects that harmed threatened or endangered species .
kempthorne also noted that any federal agency could choose to informally consult with the fish and wildlife service at any time .
h. dale hall , director of fish and wildlife , said he had concerns about how fast the estimated 235,000 public comments were processed .
staff assigned to the job spent eight hours a day tabulating the comments .
working under strict time restraints , agency employees had nine seconds to read each letter , according to one calculation .
officials said that more than 200,000 of the comments opposed the rule change .
attempts to revise the endangered species act have been rebuffed by congress in recent years .
sen. barbara boxer ( d-calif. ) said thursday 's actions were another assault on the law .
" these midnight regulations are part of a continuing effort by the bush administration to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door and weaken protections for our nation 's endangered species , " she said in a statement .
" i believe they are illegal , and if similar regulations had been in place , they would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle , the grizzly bear and the gray whale , " boxer said .
environmental groups , which took the administration to court to force it to list the polar bear , vowed to continue the legal battle .
three groups , the center for biological diversity , greenpeace and defenders of wildlife , filed suit in san francisco hours after the changes were announced , arguing that the regulations failed to follow the public review process .
" the bush administration has repackaged the same old lump of coal as a holiday present for the polar bear , and once again handed its friends in the oil industry a huge gift , " said kassie siegel , climate program director at the center for biological diversity and lead author of the 2005 petition to list polar bears .
" these regulations seem designed to drive the polar bear extinct . " .
the rule regarding polar bears comes seven months after that animal became the first to be placed on the endangered species list primarily because of global climate change .
the melting of sea ice is threatening the polar bear with extinction .
this summer , scores of polar bears were observed swimming in open seas , far from land or ice floes .
but kempthorne said that he would n't allow the 1973 law to be used as a " back door for implementing climate-change policy . " .
to that end , he clarified regulations addressing threats to polar bear habitat : greenhouse emissions from automobiles , power plants and other human activities .
the act requires federal agencies to designate habitat critical to the creature 's survival , then protect it by strict enforcement .
kempthorne said that according to his reading , court rulings require pinpointing a specific source of a threat to habitat -- something that he said was scientifically impossible .
that interpretation of the courts ' opinions gives the government few options to protect polar bear habitat .
