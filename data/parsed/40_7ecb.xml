apple inc on tuesday ( jan 6 ) introduced what it claims to be the world 's thinnest and lightest 17-inch laptop with a new unibody aluminium enclosure and a built-in battery said to deliver up to eight hours of use and a lifespan three times longer than conventional laptop batteries .
it also announced a revamp of its ilife suite of digital lifestyle software at the macworld expo trade show here , in particular the iphoto photo management software which now comes with face detection technology and built-in support for facebook .
consumers can also teach themselves to play musical instruments with the new version of garageband music creation software .
conspicuously missing from this year 's expo is the company 's iconic ceo steve jobs , who is recuperating from a health problem .
his place as keynote presenter was taken over by vice-president of worldwide product marketing phil schiller .
in a two hour-long keynote , schiller showcased the star attraction of the expo , the top-of-the-line 17-inch apple macbook pro that now features a design similar to apple 's two other laptops , the 13-inch macbook and the 15-inch macbook pro .
its body , carved out of a single block of aluminium , measures just 2.5cm thick .
the laptop weighs less than 2.99kg .
a high resolution , low power consumption led-backlit display and a large button-less trackpad made of glass has now made its way into the laptop as well .
a new built-in battery powers the laptop for eight hours on a single charge .
touted as the greenest notebook family , the new macbook pro 's battery allows up to 1,000 recharges for more than three times the lifespan of conventional laptop batteries .
the typical lifespan for laptop batteries is about three years .
the new 17-inch macbook pro will retail in malaysia for rm10,099 .
iphoto , one of five digital lifestyle software in the ilife 09 suite now , has new features called places and faces .
places automatically imports photo location data from a gps-enabled camera or an apple iphone , while with faces , iphoto automatically scans photos to detect people 's faces and when names are assigned to those faces , iphoto will find more pictures of that person .
taking things a step further , a button in iphoto enables not just convenient publishing of photos on photo sharing websites such as facebook and flickr , but also to detect even more faces on the internet .
calling them " really powerful " , schiller demonstrated how these features help organise thousands of photos .
the updated garageband 09 allows budding musicians to learn to play the piano and guitar at their own pace .
basic lessons allow newbies to learn the fundamentals while a feature called artist lessons has original artists including john fogerty , colbie caillat , norah jones and sting showing how to play their hit songs .
" ilife has become one of the reasons people buy a mac today .
there 's nothing like it on any other computing platform , " said schiller .
priced at rm299 for single user , ilife 09 will ship end of january .
also announced at macworld were updates to the company 's iwork office productivity suite .
called iwork 09 , the three software that makes up the suite , namely keynote , pages and numbers have received new themes , sophisticated transition effects and a quick way to group and summarise data .
iwork 09 is available immediately for rm299 .
the " one more thing " announcement -- jobs ' trademark way of announcing something unexpected -- was reserved for a new three-tier pricing for apple 's itunes online music store which is not available in malaysia .
jobs , who survived a pancreatic cancer in 2004 and appeared to be losing weight throughout 2008 , on monday ( jan 5 ) wrote a personal letter addressed to the apple community , saying doctors have pinpointed hormone imbalance as the reason for his illness .
" the remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and i 've already begun treatment , " he wrote , adding that he would remain as apple 's ceo and expects to be back in shape by spring this year .
