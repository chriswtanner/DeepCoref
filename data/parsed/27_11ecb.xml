microsoft releases emergency patch for ie .
microsoft on wednesday released an emergency patch to fix a perilous software flaw allowing hackers to hijack internet explorer browsers and take over computers .
the us software giant said security update ms08-078 addresses a vulnerability cyber-criminals can exploit to their advantage .
" microsoft encourages all ie customers to test and deploy this update as soon as possible , " said microsoft security response communications head christopher budd .
the threat led microsoft to mobilize security engineering teams worldwide to deliver a software cure " in the unprecedented time of eight days . " .
according to researchers at software security firm trend micro , attacks based on the vulnerability in the world 's most popular web browser were spreading " like wildfire " with millions of computers already compromised .
microsoft typically releases patches for its software on the second tuesday of each month and rushing this fix to computer users out-of-cycle is testimony to the severe danger of the threat , according to trend micro .
" people should run , not walk , to get it installed , " said trend micro advanced threat researcher paul ferguson .
" this vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber-criminals and getting worse every day . " .
the ie software patch will be automatically applied to hundreds of millions of personal computers due to standard update settings in the machines , according to microsoft security response alliance director mike reavey .
wednesday morning , business networks using ie began getting the critical fix through routine patching processes .
reavey said microsoft went into " emergency response " mode on december 9 after it first learned of the attacks on ie browsers .
a day later , microsoft published a security advisory that " listed workarounds that blocked all known attacks . " .
" over the course of the next eight days , this advisory was updated five times , adding newer workarounds and mitigations , " reavey said .
" we also continually monitored the threat environment , noting when the attacks began to change in nature and scope . " .
trend micro has identified about 10,000 websites that have been infected with malicious software that can be surreptitiously slipped into visitors ' unprotected ie browsers to take advantage of the flaw .
a major internet portal in taiwan is among the legitimate websites unknowingly tainted with malicious software aimed at ie 's weak spot , according to ferguson .
hackers can take control of infected computers , steal data , redirect browsers to dubious websites , and use machines for devious activities such as attacks on other networks , according to security specialists .
" what makes this so insidious is it takes advantage of a big gaping hole of ie , which has the largest install base of any browser on the market , " ferguson said .
ie is used on nearly three-quarters of the world 's computers , according to industry statistics from november .
reavey said the patch consists of more than 300 distinct updates for more than half-a-dozen versions of ie in scores of languages .
analyst rob enderle of enderle group in silicon valley said it was " amazing " that microsoft was able to turn out a complex critical fix in a week when such jobs typically can take a month or longer of intense work .
" even with that , the release emergency response process is n't over , " reavey said .
" there is additional support to customers and additional refinement of our product development efforts . " .
trend micro urges ie users to heed precautionary advice from microsoft , or avoid using the browsers , until the patches are applied .
the " exploit " is similar to one used recently to steal user names , passwords and other information from people playing online games in china , according to trend micro .
