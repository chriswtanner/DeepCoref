mob boss vincent "the chin" gigante , the powerful mafioso who avoided jail for decades by wandering the streets in a ratty bathrobe and slippers , feigning mental illness , died monday in prison , officials said .
he was 77 .
gigante , who had suffered from heart disease , died at the federal prison in springfield , mo . , said prison spokesman al quintero .
gigante , head of the genovese crime family , had scored a lengthy string of victories over prosecutors , but it ended with a july 1997 racketeering conviction .
after nearly a quarter - century of public craziness , he finally admitted his insanity ruse at an april 2003 federal hearing in which the man dubbed the "oddfather" by tabloid newspapers calmly pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice .
at the height of his power , gigante's empire stretched from little italy to the docks of miami .
denying he was a gangster , gigante would wander the streets of the greenwich village neighborhood in nightclothes , muttering incoherently .
relatives , including a brother was who a roman catholic priest , insisted gigante suffered from paranoid schizophrenia , dementia and alzheimer's disease .
authorities charged it was a brazen act to avoid the law - although it wasn't until 1997 that a jury agreed , and it took another six years for gigante to concede his subterfuge .
born in the bronx in 1928 , one of five sons of italian immigrant parents , gigante became a small - time boxer and drifted into the crime family founded in 1931 by legendary gangster charles "lucky" luciano .
in 1957 , gigante was the hitman in a botched attempt to assassinate then - boss frank costello .
after refusing to name his attacker in court , the shaken costello retired , making gigante's patron , vito genovese , kingpin of the family that still bears his name .
over time , gigante proved better at beating the law than john gotti , the so - called "teflon don" who won two acquittals before tapes and turncoats sent him to prison for life .
gotti died in 2002 at age 61 .
before 1997 , gigante had served only a five - year heroin rap in 1959 .
