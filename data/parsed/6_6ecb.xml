rumored to be the front runner earlier in the week , entertainment weekly has now confirmed that chris weitz will direct the sequel to twilight , new moon , replacing catherine hardwicke .
hardwicke reportedly clashed with summit entertainment during twilight 's production and ew says weitz landed the new moon gig because he has a solid relationship with the studio , he 's considered easy to work with and has experience with special effects .
in new moon , the second novel in stephenie meyer 's young-adult series , bella ( kristen stewart ) recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life .
she looks to celebrate her birthday with edward ( robert pattinson ) and his family , however , a minor accident during the festivities results in bella 's blood being shed , a sight that proves too intense for the cullens .
they decide to leave the town of forks , washington for bella and edward 's sake. melissa rosenberg is writing the screenplay .
weitz co-directed american pie , down to earth and about a boy with his brother paul .
last year he helmed the golden compass , based on the philip pullman novel , which did n't impress north american audiences but was a hit overseas .
new moon is tentatively scheduled to open november 20 , 2009 .
