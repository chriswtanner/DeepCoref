the cupertino , calif.-based company ( nasdaq : aapl ) said itunes songs will now have three-tiered pricing : 69 cents , 99 cents and $ 1.29 , depending on how new or desirable the songs are judged to be .

the new notebook is expected to ship in late january with a price tag of $ 2,799 for the base model that will have 4 gigabytes of ram and a 320 gigabyte hard drive .
the new version of ilife includes changes to its photo , movie and music software .
the updated iphoto lets users tag photos according to who is in them or where they were taken .
the places feature either picks up the tag from a camera 's gps system or the information can be put in manually .
the new iphoto software also supports photos tagging at social networking sites facebook and flickr .
