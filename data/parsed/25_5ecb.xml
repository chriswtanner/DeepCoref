in case you had any doubts whether or not pierre thomas ( left ) would get more carries than reggie bush , you can now have full faith in thomas .
after spraining his knee last week at chicago , bush has been placed on the injured reserve list ending his season .
hello , mr. thomas. owners have been worried that thomas ' carries would be affected by bush 's return , but those worries are all for naught .
with bush completely out of the picture , thomas is the lone back and could capitalize in a big way in his two remaining games .
remember , thomas is still playing for a contract .
the saints take on the 0-14 lions , and it appears the saints will march into motown and hand them no. 15 .
the lions have the league 's worst rushing defense , and teams do n't need to throw a lot because offenses are able to run wild .
good news for pierre owners .
thomas is an elite rb going forward , and those of you lucky enough to nab him should reap the benefits. make sure he 's in your lineups for championship weeks .
since week 11 , thomas has eight touchdowns on 498 rushing yards and 176 receiving yards .
not bad for a late waiver-wire guy , huh ?
as far as bush is concerned , the saints are erring on the side of caution regarding the injury .
with the playoffs out of the picture , there 's no need to worsen the injury .
he 'll be a top ppr running back in 2009 .
