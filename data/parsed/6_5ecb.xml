there 's a new dawn for twilight .
days after catherine hardwicke was ousted , despite having directed the vampire romance satisfactorily enough to pull in $ 140 million worth of business from fanggirls and average moviegoers alike , the golden compass director chris weitz is close to signing on for the blockbuster 's sequel .
following up on some recent deadline hollywood scoop , ew.com reports that weitz has been tapped by summit entertainment to helm new moon , based on the second book in stephenie meyer 's phenomenon-inducing franchise .
" he 's the quality-of-life-choice , " a source said , perhaps referring to buzz that hardwicke , while ultratalented , is rough to work with , while weitz , who also codirected american pie and scored an oscar nod for copenning about a boy , is known to be a pretty genial chap .
summit says that no deal has been signed yet , but the official announcement could be coming as soon as this weekend .
the studio wants new moon in theaters and edward-loving butts in the seats in 2010 , but has said it will not rush production before the script ( the initial draft of which hardwicke supposedly had problems with ) is the best it can be .
" this is not a rush job , " summit ceo rob friedman told the los angeles times ' big picture blog .
" the movie only gets released when it 's finished. i 'd like it to be next year , but we 're not going to put out a bad movie to hit a release date . " .
