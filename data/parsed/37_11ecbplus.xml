afp , tuesday 2 jul 2013 .
a strong 6 . 1 - magnitude earthquake struck the northwestern indonesian province of aceh on tuesday , the us geological survey said , sending people running into the streets in panic .
there were no immediate reports of damage after the quake struck inland at a depth of just 10 kilometres ( 6 . 2 miles ) , 55 kilometres south of bireun and 72 kilometres southeast of reuleuet , said the usgs .
people ran out of buildings in panic in the provincial capital banda aceh as the quake shook houses for around one minute , an afp journalist at the scene said .
but the usgs estimated there was a low likelihood of casualties or damage .
a massive quake struck off aceh in 2004 , sparking a tsunami that killed 170 , 000 people in the province on sumatra and tens of thousands more in countries around the indian ocean .
indonesia sits on the pacific "ring of fire" where continental plates collide , causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity .
