anti piracy ops by ins sukanya .
indian naval ship sukanya , presently deployed on anti - piracy patrols in the gulf of aden under the operational control of the western naval command , found herself once again in the thick of things , thwarting a multiple - boat piracy attack on 10 nov 11 .
the ship was escorting a group of five merchant vessels through the irtc ( internationally recognised transit corridor ) when , at about 9 : 25 in the morning of 10th nov , she detected a group of five suspicious boats , speedily approaching the merchant vessels of her group .
the warship immediately altered towards the suspicious vessels and challenged them .
on seeing the resolve evident in the warship's action and probably mindful of the reputation for resolute action that the indian navy justly enjoys in such deployments , the pirate skiffs reversed course and tried to flee the area .
while two of them managed to get away , the sukanya successfully intercepted the remaining three and carried out well practiced and professionally executed boarding - and - search action .
the three boats had a total of 26 somali crew onboard .
during the operation , six ak 47 rifles , 12 magazines and about 300 rounds of ammunition were found and confiscated .
in addition , the boarding party also found a host of other equipment such as grapnels , ladders and rope - handling gloves all of which confirmed their piratical intent .
the timely operation by sukanya resulted , once again , in foiling the pirates' intention of attacking merchant vessels transiting this busy sea lane through which over a hundred billion dollars of india's external trade passes each year .
this is the fifth successful anti - piracy operation conducted by sukanya , in the course of her ongoing patrol mission in the gulf of aden , which commenced in september .
the ship has , thus far , confiscated a total of 14 ak 47 rifles , 31 magazines and 923 rounds of ammunition , thereby ensuring that the indian navy retains its standing as a force not to be trifled with , and remains at the forefront of anti - piracy operations , as a critical component of the international effort to curb piracy and ensure the safety and freedom of seaborne trade , even in this highly risk - prone area .
