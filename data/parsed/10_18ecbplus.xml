report : red sox make huge offer to teixeira .
on tuesday , 16 december 2008 13 : 45 .
the boston red sox have made the biggest offer in club history to mark teixeira .
the deal is said to be for 8 year and could be up to $180 million .
with the economy going down and ticket prices frozen you have to wonder how the red sox plan on making this kind of committment for the long term .
does this mean they will not be able to get that big free agent next year or the year after that ?
the farm system has been good but it can not replace eveything and the sox are going to need some front line starters in the next few years .
we just have to say "in theo we trust" with this one .
