protesters enraged over the fatal shooting of a teenager by police poured into brooklyn streets for a third straight night wednesday , pitching bricks , bottles and garbage in furious clashes with cops .
at least 46 demonstrators were arrested along church ave . in east flatbush .
police struggled to control a hostile crowd that broke away from a planned peaceful vigil for kimani ( kiki ) gray , 16 , killed by police on saturday night .
gray " s sister mahnefeh was among those arrested .
a police officer suffered a gash in the face when a tossed brick hit him , nypd spokesman paul browne said , and a window was smashed in an inspector " s car .
" they didn " t have to kill him , " makaeo williams , 18 , said as police on motorcycles tracked alongside him .
" i " m feeling mad inside .
i " m angry .
that " s why i " m out here . " .
many in the community contest police allegations that gray pointed a gun at cops when he was shot during a confrontation with two plainclothes officers on e . 52nd st . saturday night .
those suspicions on the street intensified wednesday when an autopsy report revealed gray was hit by seven bullets -- three to the back .
it was not clear in what order the shots struck the teen or whether he had his back to the police when they opened fire .
a witness told the daily news tuesday that the youth did not have a gun in his hand .
but a police spokesman said the witness told detectives she couldn " t see the incident clearly " from the angle i was at . " .
a woman who identified herself as gray " s cousin told news outlets wednesday that the teen was carrying a gun for a friend and was trying to alert cops that he had a weapon when he was shot .
a loaded . 38 - caliber revolver was recovered at the scene .
the trouble wednesday night began soon after more than 200 people set off from the vigil site at church ave . and e . 55th st . around 8 : 30 p . m .
dozens chanted " nypd , kkk , how many kids did you kill today " as they marched west on church ave . toward the 67th precinct stationhouse .
but things quickly got out of hand as some protesters tried to climb on police motorcycles .
men and women were pepper - sprayed and thrown to the ground and handcuffed .
" i " m scared for everything , myself , my store , my workers , " said salm sami , 45 , who owns the deli , grill & grocery at church and new york aves .
" this is three days of this . " .
the protesters eventually backtracked to the vigil site where the parents of ramarley graham -- an unarmed teenager fatally shot by police in the bronx last year -- were waiting .
" it never seems to end , " said frank graham , ramarley " s father .
" the community has a right to be angry . " .
but city councilman jumaane williams , a frequent nypd critic , blasted outsiders who he said escalated tensions .
" please stay the hell out of our community will only agitate our kids , " williams fumed on twitter .
" it " s dangerous and counterproductive . " .
