"our country has reached the edge of the abyss .
it is the responsibility of us all to not take the step into the void .
"what is at stake in coming days is to keep social cohesion and social peace . " .
greek prime minister george papandreou said the firebombing was a "raw murderous act" .
athens underground stations were shuttered and the international airport deserted as tens of thousands of union members rallied on the eve of a vote in parliament on the planned cuts and tax hikes .
the general strike was the first major test of the socialist government's resolve to push through unprecedented measures since agreeing a ����110 billion ( $158 billion ) eu and imf debt bailout over the weekend .
prime minister george papandreou's insistence that the measures are vital for the nation's survival failed to dissuade unions from paralysing public transport , grounding air traffic and preventing ferries from leaving docks .
after rallying in two separate demonstrations in central athens , members of the main unions began converging on parliament , where the government was preparing for the measures to be voted on thursday .
