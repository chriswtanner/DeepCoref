a fire that caused more than $ 1 million in damage to alaska gov. sarah palin 's church in wasilla , alaska , may have been set by an arsonist , investigators say .
flames and smoke were coming from the wasilla bible church friday evening when as many as 30 to 40 volunteer firefighters arrived at the three-story structure , and officials said saturday they were treating the fire as a possible arson , the anchorage daily news reported sunday .
" we are definitely treating it as suspicious and as potential arson at this point , " james steele , chief of the central mat-su fire department , told the newspaper , adding nothing so far suggests any political motivation for the fire .
" right now there 's no indication that we have that there 's any connection there , " he said .
" we just do n't have any leads at all as far as the intent or motive in this . " .
" we have no idea what caused it , " the rev. larry kroon of the wasilla bible church told cnn .
palin apologized to church 's assistant pastor saturday if the fire was connected to her republican u.s. vice-presidential candidacy , a statement from her office said .
