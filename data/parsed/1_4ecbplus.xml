lindsay lohan checks into rehab , checks out two minutes later .
may 2 , 2013 .
the judge should know to never ever trust a gnome with a law degree , because they are shifty shits and will lie to you with a twinkle in their eyes .
that " s exactly what lilo " s lawyer mark heller did in court this morning .
he told the judge that lilo was " ensconced in the bosom of " rehab this morning when she was really buying crap at fry " s in fountain valley , ca .
the nydn says that lilo eventually made it to morningside recovery in newport beach , but two minutes after she walked through the door , she walked back through it and left .
according to the nydn , lilo showed up to morningside at around noon , spent a couple of minutes there , got spooked by the paparazzi ( uh huh ) and then jumped back into her suv .
