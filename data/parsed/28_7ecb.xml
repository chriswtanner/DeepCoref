mark felt , fbi official who became 'deep throat , ' dead at 95 .
w. mark felt , who was the no. 2 official at the fbi when he helped bring down president richard m. nixon by resisting the watergate cover-up and becoming deep throat , the most famous anonymous source in american history , died on thursday .
he was 95 and lived in santa rosa .
his death was confirmed by rob jones , his grandson .
in 2005 , felt revealed that he was the source who had secretly supplied bob woodward of the washington post with crucial leads in the watergate affair in the early nineteen seventies .
his decision to unmask himself , in an article in vanity fair , ended a guessing game that had gone on for more than 30 years .
the disclosure even surprised woodward and his partner on the watergate story , carl bernstein .
they had kept their promise not to reveal his identity until after his death .
indeed , woodward was so scrupulous about shielding felt that he did not introduce him to bernstein until this year , 36 years after they cracked the scandal .
the three met for two hours one afternoon in november in santa rosa , where felt had retired .
the reporters likened it to a family reunion .
felt played a dual role in nixon 's downfall .
as a secret informant , he kept the story alive in the press .
as associate director of the fbi , he fought the president 's efforts to obstruct the fbi 's investigation of the watergate break-in .
felt later said he believed that nixon had been misusing the fbi for political advantage .
he knew that nixon wanted the watergate affair to vanish .
he knew that the white house had ordered the cia to tell the bureau , on grounds of national security , to stand down in its felony investigation of the june 1972 break-in .
he saw that order as an effort to obstruct justice , and he rejected it .
that resistance led indirectly to nixon 's resignation .
passed up for promotion .
felt had expected to be named to succeed j. edgar hoover , who had run the bureau for 48 years and died in may 1972 .
the president instead chose a politically loyal justice department official , l. patrick gray , who later followed orders from the white house to destroy documents in the case .
the choice infuriated felt .
he later wrote that the president " wanted a politician in j. edgar hoover 's position who would convert the bureau into an adjunct of the white house machine . " .
hoover had sworn off break-ins without warrants - " black bag jobs , " he called them - in 1966 , after carrying them out at the fbi for four decades .
the nixon white house hired its own operatives to steal information , plant eavesdropping equipment and hunt down the sources of leaks .
the watergate break-in took place six weeks after hoover died .
while watergate was seething , felt authorized nine illegal break-ins at the homes of friends and relatives of members of the weather underground , a violent left-wing splinter group .
the people he chose as targets had committed no crimes .
the fbi had no search warrants .
he later said he ordered the break-ins because he felt national security required it .
in a criminal trial , felt was convicted in november 1980 of conspiring to violate the constitutional rights of americans .
nixon , who had denounced him in private for leaking watergate secrets , testified on his behalf .
called by the prosecution , he told the jury that presidents and by extension their officers had an inherent right to conduct illegal searches in the name of national security .
" as deep throat , felt helped establish the principle that our highest government officials are subject to the constitution and the laws of the land , " the prosecutor , john w. nields , wrote in the washington post in 2005 .
" yet when it came to the weather underground bag jobs , he seems not to have been aware that this same principle applied to him . " .
seven months after the conviction , president ronald reagan pardoned felt .
then 67 , felt celebrated the decision as one of great symbolic value .
" this is going to be the biggest shot in the arm for the intelligence community for a long time , " he said .
after the pardon , nixon sent him a congratulatory bottle of champagne .
felt then disappeared from public view for a quarter of a century , denying unequivocally , time and again , that he had been deep throat .
it was a lie he told to serve what he believed to be a higher truth .
william mark felt was born in twin falls , idaho , on aug. 17 , 1913 .
after graduating from the university of idaho , he was drawn to public service in washington and went to work for sen. james p. pope , d-idaho .
in 1938 , he married his college sweetheart , audrey robinson , in washington .
they were wed by the chaplain of the house of representatives .
she died in 1984 .
the couple had a daughter , joan , and a son , mark .
they and four grandsons survive felt .
days before pearl harbor , after earning a law degree in night classes at george washington university , felt applied to the fbi and joined it in january 1942 .
he spent most of world war ii hunting german spies .
after stints in seattle , new orleans and los angeles , hoover named him special agent in charge of the salt lake city and kansas city offices in the late nineteen fifties .
rising to high positions at the headquarters in the 1960s , he oversaw the training of fbi agents and conducted internal investigations as chief of the inspection division .
in early 1970 , while waiting in an anteroom of the west wing of the white house , felt chanced to meet a navy lieutenant delivering classified messages to the national security council staff .
the young man in dress blues was bob woodward .
by his own description fiercely ambitious and in need of adult guidance , woodward tried to wring career counseling from his elder .
he left the white house with the number to felt 's direct line at the fbi .
on july 1 , 1971 , hoover promoted felt to deputy associate director , the third in command at the headquarters , beneath hoover 's right-hand man and longtime companion , clyde a. tolson .
with both of his superiors in poor health , felt increasingly took effective command of the daily work of the fbi .
when hoover died and tolson retired , he saw his path to power cleared .
but nixon denied him , and he seethed with frustrated ambition in summer 1972 .
breaking watergate .
one evening that summer , a few weeks after the watergate break-in , woodward , then a neophyte newspaperman , knocked on felt 's door in pursuit of the story .
felt decided to cooperate with him and set up an elaborate system of espionage techniques for clandestine meetings with woodward .
if woodward needed to talk , he would move a flowerpot planted with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment on p street in washington .
if felt had a message , woodward 's home-delivered new york times would arrive with an inked circle on page 20 .
woodward would leave his apartment by the back alley that night and take one taxi to a downtown hotel , then a second to an underground parking garage in the rosslyn section of arlington , virginia .
within weeks , felt steered the post to a story establishing that the watergate break-in was part of " a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage " directed by the white house .
for the next eight months , he did his best to keep the newspaper on the trail , largely by providing , on " deep background , " anonymous confirmation of facts reporters had gathered from others .
the post 's managing editor , howard simons , gave him his famous pseudonym , taken from the pornographic movie then in vogue .
millions of americans knew him only as a shadowy figure in the 1976 movie made from the watergate saga , " all the president 's men , " which made " woodward and bernstein " legends of american journalism .
in the movie , deep throat ( hal holbrook ) gives woodward ( robert redford ) probably the most famous bit of free advice in the history of investigative journalism .
it was a three-word road map to the heart of the matter : " follow the money . " .
felt never said it .
it was part of the myth that surrounded deep throat .
