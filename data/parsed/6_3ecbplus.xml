despite currently being the director behind the #1 movie in the world , the future of gary ross's involvement with the hunger games franchise remains uncertain .
the hollywood reporter says ross is in negotiations with lionsgate to return as director for the sequel , catching fire - - and the deal likely hinges on money .
thr says ross , a seasoned director , accepted a relatively low $3 million salary for directing ( and co - writing ) the hunger games , but is asking for a significant raise for catching fire .
despite thr's article , which paints negotiations as tense , ross has spoken very confidently about his involvement in catching fire - - even mentioning casting ideas and filming plans - - and it seems likely he will officially be signed on as director .
meanwhile , the film's main stars , including jennifer lawrence , josh hutcherson , and liam hemsworth , are all signed on for the rest of the movies in the series .
several additional new characters will need to be cast before catching fire can begin filming later this year , however .
