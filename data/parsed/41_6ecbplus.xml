south sudan accuses sudan of bombing civilian camp amid fears of war .
published : november 10 , 2011 .
civilians fled as bombs fell on a camp for displaced people in south sudan on thursday , and president salva kiir accused the sudanese government of planning to invade his newly independent nation .
less than six months after south sudan broke away from sudan , an act that was the culmination of a peace accord to end decades of civil war , tensions between the neighbors are crystallizing into fears of direct confrontation .
speaking in south sudan's capital , juba , mr . kiir denounced the sudanese government for threatening what he called a "military invasion" of south sudan , and he rejected accusations by the sudanese government that his country was arming sudanese rebels as "utterly baseless and malicious . " .
mr . kiir has also accused the sudanese government of bombing the south sudanese area of guffa in recent days , killing at least seven people and potentially moving the insurgencies on both sides of the border closer to an international conflict .
the united states issued a statement on thursday condemning "in the strongest possible terms" what it called "negative developments" between the nations , particularly the airstrike by the sudanese forces .
"the provocative aerial bombardments near the border increase the potential of direct confrontation between sudan and south sudan , " the american statement said .
sudan has denied striking south sudanese territory .
nevertheless , on thursday afternoon an antonov bomber dropped four bombs on the south sudanese area of yida , hitting a refugee camp of roughly 21 , 000 people , some of them northern sudanese who had crossed the border since the rebellion in sudan began .
according to an aid worker with knowledge of the event , two bombs fell on an airstrip , one hit a school and one landed on a market , but did not detonate .
there were varying reports of casualties , but none could be confirmed .
while the two nations continue to discuss how to split lucrative oil revenues and the fate of the contested region of abyei , a spreading rebellion inside sudan has prompted the sudanese government to accuse the south of providing military support to the rebels .
last week , the sudanese government lodged a formal complaint with the united nations security council , arguing that south sudan was trying to start a border war .
"we don't have any intention to go to war again , but it is now up to the southern government to either strengthen its state without hostility , or to disturb us , " said a sudanese government spokesman , rabie a . atti .
"if they come to war , they will lose a lot . " .
many residents in the sudanese provinces of southern kordofan and blue nile fought alongside the south during its civil war with the north .
but the 2005 peace treaty placed the two provinces in sudan's territory , leaving south sudan to hold a referendum to decide its own fate .
in january , the south sudanese voted almost unanimously to secede from the rest of the country .
their fellow combatants in southern kordofan and blue nile remained on the other side of the border , and an armed rebellion soon began .
"we are ready to fight and continue until we reach khartoum , " the sudanese capital , said one of the rebel leaders , abdel aziz al - hilu , in a september interview .
"we are prepared for a protracted war , a long war , " he added , "in order to see this regime ousted . " .
in return , the sudanese military has clamped down hard on the rebellion , filling the skies over southern kordofan and blue nile with antonov bombers , some of which have flown over south sudanese territory , too .
a satellite imaging project organized by the enough project , an advocacy group , has published what it says is evidence of mass graves in the rebellious regions , and the united nations has said the military activity could amount to war crimes .
the united states , a close partner of south sudan , had made strong overtures to the government in sudan , saying that if it cooperated peacefully with south sudan's transition to independence , economic sanctions on the country could be lifted .
but last week , president obama seemed to change his mind , calling for sanctions to be extended over what he called "hostile" actions on the part of the sudanese government that posed an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to american foreign policy .
"they promised us a lot of things ; nothing actually implemented , " said mr . atti , the sudanese government spokesman .
"it's unfair . " .
south sudan - or sudan - can ill afford a new war .
the economies of both nations are in a delicate state , with sudan suffering from a loss of oil income since south sudan's independence , and protests springing up in the streets of khartoum early this year .
as for south sudan , it is one of the least developed countries in the world .
furthermore , it faces a number of internal rebellions itself , particularly in provinces near the border , and it has accused the sudanese government of backing militias there .
"the overall view is that they have to exist with the other side , " said aly verjee , a senior researcher at the rift valley institute .
"even if you don't trust them so much , and if they are meddling in your own sovereign territory , there is a lot riding on that . " .
