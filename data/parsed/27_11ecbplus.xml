microsoft releases security patch for internet explorer .
reuters sep 18 , 2013 , 02 . 16pm ist .
microsoft released an emergency software fix for internet explorer on tuesday after hackers exploited a security flaw in the popular web browser to attack an unknown number of users .
the software maker said on its website it released the software , known as a "fix it , " as an emergency measure to protect customers after learning about "extremely limited , targeted attacks" that made use of the newly discovered bug .
microsoft said the attacks took advantage of an undiscovered flaw , or "zero day" vulnerability in industry parlance .
state - sponsored hacking groups are often willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for zero - day vulnerabilities in widely used software such as internet explorer , according to security experts who track that market .
they typically use them on small numbers of carefully selected , high - value targets , to keep such flaws secret .
once microsoft issues a warning about a zero - day bug , other groups of hackers involved in massive cyber - crime operations , such as identity theft , rush to reverse - engineer the fix its so they can build computer viruses that also exploit the same vulnerabilities .
security experts said internet explorer users should either immediately install the fix it or stop using the browser until microsoft can put out an update , which will be automatically installed through its windows update program .
"with the fix it out , i'm sure any attacker who is a bit sophisticated can figure out what the flaw is and implement a similar exploit in their own attack toolkit , " said wolfgang kandek , chief technology officer with the cybersecurity firm qualys inc .
"fix its" are pieces of software for remediating security flaws that must be downloaded and installed on pcs .
they are designed to protect customers while microsoft prepares official updates , automatically delivered via the internet to be installed on computers .
kandek said he expects microsoft to push out an update to address the issue within two to three weeks .
the fix it can be installed by clicking on a link this page on microsoft's support site .
