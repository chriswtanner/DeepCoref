new orleans saints place pierre thomas on injured reserve list .
the new orleans saints have placed running back pierre thomas on the injured reserve list a day after their leading rusher , chris ivory , was shut down for the season .
with a playoff game looming saturday on what probably will be a wet field in a tough stadium in seattle , reggie bush and julius jones will step up to replace the saints' top two running backs .
"i don't know that this is a rallying cry , " coach sean payton said of the injuries ( via jeff duncan of the times - picayune ) .
"we've gone through this before .
it's not uncommon .
it's more the norm . " .
thomas had a setback with an ankle injury in practice last week and , payton said , everyone "felt this was the best move . " .
the saints signed deshawn wynn on tuesday and joique bell today off the philadelphia eagles' practice squad .
