tara reid has entered a rehab program , the american pie star 's rep confirmed to people and us weekly on friday .
the news comes as a shock for everyone who just assumed the seldom-seen actress had been holed up there for a while - at least when she was n't touring u.s. frat houses and/or tequila conventions .
" tara reid has checked herself into promises treatment center , " reid 's rep told us .
" we appreciate your respect to her and her family 's privacy at this time . " .
no specific reason or addiction was given for her treatment .
when reid was n't getting attention for her sometimes fun/sometimes scary breasts , the actress was getting attention for her often-shambolic love of partying .
reid 's messy lifestyle led to her short lived e ! -series , taradise , that followed her to exotic locales where she would party .
somehow , reid managed to mess up the dream-job/easiest job ever by being too wasted and out of control to film it .
" it was a mess , " she said of the show .
" i did n't know it was going to ruin my career .
people forget i 've done , like , 20 movies .
i 'm not just a party girl. " .
while reid has been out of the cinematic spotlight , she recently launched a clothing line , mantra , and is dating french fashion designer julien jarmoune .
in an interview in october , reid told people she was a " social drinker " who 's no longer tempted to fall back into her old habits .
" no .
i 've done it .
trust me .
i 've done enough for a lifetime of everything .
i 've had a great time .
i partied .
i had fun .
i ate and drank whatever .
i dated a million guys , but i 'm so happy with where i 'm at right now .
i do n't need to do anything anymore . " .
