3 dead after protesters torch greek bank .
updated thu 6 may 2010 , 9 : 03am aest .
three people died in a burning bank as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of athens during a general strike over the greek government's planned spending cuts .
some protesters tried to storm parliament while others threw petrol bombs at police and torched buildings in protest against new austerity measures and a decision to raise taxes to meet the conditions of its international bailout .
a petrol bomb hurled at an athens branch of the marfin investment bank killed two women and a man who were caught in the resulting inferno .
it was always going to be hard to convince greeks that ripping $43 billion out of their public services and hiking their taxes was a necessary consequence of the international bailout .
as the greek prime minister george papandreou looked out from his parliamentary office , he saw exactly how angry they were .
"we are all deeply shocked by the unjust death of three of our citizens - citizens that were victims of a raw , murderous act , " mr papandreou said .
a professor of economics at the university of athens , yanis varoufakis , did not go to work today because it was not safe .
but he rode his bicycle into the city to survey the aftermath of the day's mass demonstration .
"what i did witness was the battlefields after the troops had departed , " he said .
"there were a few still burning or smoking cars , a couple of fire engines that had been torched , a building that belongs to the finance ministry - not far away from home - was completely burned down .
"otherwise , it was an empty city without people . " .
professor varoufakis blames angry youths for the violence and deaths .
"it seems it was a large demonstration , which unfortunately was infiltrated by the usual band of 100 or 200 professional [ trouble - makers ] , " he said .
"they're the ones who created the circumstances for the death , the tragic death and loss of those three people . " .
but professor varoufakis says there is "a very deep sense of injustice" across greece .
"in the foreign media , even the local media , there is a portrayal of the greek people living above their means , who are lazy , who are not working .
the truth , as always , is quite different from appearances , " he said .
"this is a country of incredibly hard - working people , people who have two and three jobs in order to make ends meet .
"greece is also a country with the highest degree of poverty outside of latvia in the whole of europe , not just the eurozone , and it is a country in which a great deal of money was made over the last 10 - 20 years , but it was highly concentrated in a very small percentage of the population .
"the rest have been struggling through the good times , through times of economic growth , to survive .
not to have a good life but just to survive , and they are the ones who now have to foot the bill for the economic collapse . " .
as athens burned , many in berlin were still fuming about having to foot most of the bill for greek profligacy .
german chancellor angela merkel addressed parliament , raising her voice above the catcalls and angry hecklers from the opposition parties .
"this is about nothing less than the future of europe and with it the future of germany in europe , " she said .
approval ratings for the chancellor have dropped six points since the aid package for greece was announced .
ms merkel might pay a higher political price on the weekend when crucial regional elections are held .
