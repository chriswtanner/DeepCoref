the missouri valley conference , aka "arch madness" , certainly lived up to its nickname on friday .
eight teams competed in the quarterfinal round , and we've already had one memorable last - second game .
now there's just four teams left fighting for the automatic bid on saturday .
let's recap friday's action .
no . 1 creighton bluejays 65 , no . 9 drake bulldogs 53 .
doug mcdermott put on a show as usual , scoring 23 points and becoming the school's all - time leader in points scored .
he had help from his teammates , as well , as gregory echenique finished with a double - double ( 11 points , 11 rebounds ) .
the bulldgos never let this game turn into a blowout , but they never came close enough to make creighton sweat , either .
the bluejays will play indiana state on saturday .
