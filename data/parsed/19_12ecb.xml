ricochet killed greek teenager .
initial results from the post- mortem on a 15-year-old greek boy whose killing by police sparked five days of rioting show alexandros grigoropoulos died from a bullet ricochet .
according to forensic doctors and independent experts hired by the grigoropoulos family , the bullet " is a bit deformed , which showed the bullet touched a hard surface " before entering the boy 's chest , court sources said last night .
the news came as two police officers charged over the shooting prepared to go before a magistrate and riot police fired teargas at thousands of demonstrators advancing on the national parliament building in athens .
" now that we have these conclusions , which are in line with what my clients had indicated , they will give their statements to the judge , " said alexis kouyias , the lawyer for policemen epaminondas korkoneas and vassilis saraliotis .
amid anger towards the police compounded by the unpopularity of the government of prime minister costas karamanlis , greece is still awaiting a final ballistics report expected to shed light on mr korkoneas 's statement that the bullet bounced up off a pavement after he had fired warning shots to disperse a mob .
alexandros was allegedly among a group of 30 youths that had thrown stones at the squad car in the exarchia district of athens , which is known as a stronghold of political radicals .
riot police fired teargas at youths throwing molotov cocktails outside parliament last night , as a general strike paralysed greece and raised pressure on a fragile government reeling from four days of riots sparked by the police shooting .
the clashes escalated into running battles through the city centre , with riot police firing volleys of teargas at masked youths pelting them with rocks , bottles and blocks of marble smashed from the athens metro station entrance .
the youths smashed windows newly replaced after four days of the worst riots greece has seen in decades .
more than 10,000 people had been marching through central athens to protest the conservative government 's economic policies in a general strike that has shut down schools , public services and hospitals and grounded flights .
although the strike and demonstrations had been scheduled long before the riots broke out , they have taken on the added form of protest against the government 's handling of the riots .
