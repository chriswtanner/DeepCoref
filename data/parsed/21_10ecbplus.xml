a hit - and - run accident may be considered an example of extreme recklessness or carelessness on the part of a driver .
a personal injury attorney might review a hit - and - run accident case and suggest seeking punitive damages .
in some instances , it is possible to collect damages that exceed compensation for lost wages , medical expenses and funeral costs .
the intention is to punish reckless and negligent drivers and also to send a message to other drivers .
if the family wishes to seek only compensation for accident - related expenses , the attorney may negotiate for a settlement outside of court .
on the other hand , if the family decides to seek punitive damages , the attorney might request a jury trial in civil court .
if the at - fault driver was charged or convicted in criminal court , it may help support the claim of recklessness .
the attorney may use police reports , photos and evidence to build a convincing argument on behalf of the family .
if the judge and jury are persuaded by the argument and evidence presented , they may find in favor of the plaintiffs and award punitive damages .
