ellen degeneres to host oscars in 2014 .
this will be second time hosting for the daytime talkshow star who will follow on from seth macfarlane's savaged 2013 stint .
the comedian ellen degeneres announced on friday that she is to return as host of the academy awards , the second time she has been tasked with saving the oscars a year after a poorly received performer .
for the 2014 show , she follows a heavily criticised performance this year by the family guy creator seth macfarlane .
in 2007 , she put the oscars back on an even keel after poor reviews for the satirist jon stewart in 2006 .
"i am so excited to be hosting the oscars for the second time .
you know what they say -- the third time's the charm , " degeneres said in a statement .
she is a safe bet for the academy , following an outraged reaction to the misogynistic jokes that peppered macfarlane's script .
while macfarlane's performance generated high ratings for the broadcast -- 40 . 3 million people watched , 2% higher than the year before -- he said he would not host the oscars again because of the negative response .
degeneres however , has a history of well - received hosting gigs .
she was nominated for a primetime emmy for her performance as oscars host in 2007 .
she also garnered positive responses as a two - time emmy awards host , carrying the ceremony shortly after 9 / 11 and then after hurricane katrina .
her previous oscar gig , in which martin scorsese's the departed took home the top prize , was watched by 39 . 9 million people .
degeneres made the announcement on twitter on friday and said : "it's official : i'm hosting the #oscars !
i'd like to thank @theacademy , my wife portia and , oh dear , there goes the orchestra . " .
academy award producers craig zadan and neil meron said in a statement : "we are thrilled to have ellen degeneres host the oscars . " .
