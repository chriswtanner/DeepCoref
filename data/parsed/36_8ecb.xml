polygamous leaders arrested in canada , ordered to surrender passports .
two leaders of polygamous groups with ties to utah have been arrested in canada , charged with practicing polygamy .
one of the wives of former fundamentalist lds church leader winston blackmore confirmed his arrest wednesday .
" it 's for polygamy , " she said , declining to give her name but telling the deseret news she was one of blackmore 's wives .
she also said flds bishop jim oler was also arrested .
the criminal charges were filed tuesday in creston , british columbia .
in canada , polygamy is illegal .
the royal canadian mounted police said they began their investigation in 2005 and revisited it earlier this year after a special prosecutor recommended charges .
the prosecutor recommended polygamy and sexual exploitation charges but british columbia attorney general wally oppal opted to only pursue polygamy charges , noting that blackmore has 20 wives and oler has two .
" the defendants should raise any constitutional issues , " oppal said , in response to questions about polygamists ' religious freedoms claims .
oppal denied that the prosecution was political , despite the former attorney general for british columbia and several special prosecutors declining to pursue charges against anyone in the fundamentalist enclave of bountiful .
both blackmore and oler were to be released from rcmp custody late wednesday pending a future court appearance .
they were ordered by a judge to surrender their passports , check in with rcmp authorities , not leave british columbia and perform no " celestial marriages , " said rcmp sgt. tim shields .
a spokesman for the flds church did not immediately return a call seeking comment .
news of the charges stunned many .
" i 'm shocked .
i really am , " said mary batchelor , the director of the utah-based pro-polygamy group principle voices .
" i 'm amazed they are actually doing that . " .
batchelor said she had been in contact with some of blackmore 's wives , whom she said were understandably upset .
blackmore was a bishop in the utah-based flds church until he was excommunicated in 2002 .
the fundamentalists who live in bountiful , british columbia , split with some following blackmore and others remaining in the flds church led by warren jeffs .
oler was a bishop in bountiful , the flds enclave there .
the attorney general of british columbia has been probing the polygamous communities on allegations of sex abuse , human trafficking and forced marriages .
several special prosecutors were appointed to give opinions on prosecuting polygamy laws in canada .
in an e-mail to the deseret news in 2006 , blackmore acknowledged being the subject of a canadian police inquiry .
" since we are not hiding we are not hard to find , " he wrote .
" it is hard to think that canada , the home of free lovers and legalized same-sex marriages , not to mention legal wife-swapping clubs , could waste their time on people who live like we do . " .
