severed cable disrupts net access .
internet and phone communications between europe , the middle east , and asia have been seriously disrupted after submarine cables were severed .
it is thought the flag fea , smw4 , and smw3 lines , near the alexandria cable station in egypt , have all been cut .
a fault was also reported on the go submarine cable 130km off sicily .
experts warned that it may be days before the fault is fixed and said the knock on effect could have serious repercussions on regional economies .
jonathan wright - director of wholesale products at interoute which manages part of the optical fibre network - told the bbc that the effects of the break would be felt for many days .
" this will grind economies to a halt for a short space of time , " he said .
" if you look at , say , local financial markets who trade with european and us markets , the speed at which they get live data will be compromised . " .
" if you think how quickly trades can be placed , if they are suffering from bad latency times , then by the time a trade is placed , the market may well have moved on . " .
the cause of the break is as yet unknown , although some seismic activity was reported near malta shortly before the cut was detected .
in a statement released in relation to one of the breaks , france telecom said : " the causes of the cut , which is located in the mediterranean between sicily and tunisia , on sections linking sicily to egypt , remain unclear . " .
the french firm said it was sending a ship out to fix the line between italy and egypt , although it could take until 31 december to fully repair the line .
the main damage is to the four submarine cables running across the mediterranean and through the suez canal .
it is thought that 65 % of traffic to india was down , while services to singapore , malaysia , saudi arabia , egypt , taiwan and pakistan have also been severely affected .
earlier this year , the same line was damaged in the same area - off the egyptian coast - although only two lines were snapped then .
" we 've lost three out of four lines .
if the fourth cable breaks , we 're looking at a total blackout in the middle east , " said mr wright .
" these three circuits account for 90 % of the traffic and we 're going to see more international phone calls dropping and a huge degradation in the quality of local internet , " he added .
" normally you would expect to see one major break per cable per year .
with four you should have an insurance policy .
for this to happen twice in one year , on the same cable , is a serious cause for concern . " .
