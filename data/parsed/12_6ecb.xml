the indian navy on saturday foiled a hijack attempt in the notorious gulf of aden and arrested 23 heavily armed somalian and yemeni pirates .
within minutes of receiving a distress call from an ethiopian vessel , mv gibe , ins mysore , a delhi-class destroyer , launched an armed helicopter with marine commandos onboard to stop the pirates from boarding and hijacking the vessel .
the skipper of the ethiopian vessel , sailing 150 nautical miles west of aden , radioed a message at around 11 am ( ist ) saying that pirates had brought his ship under heavy fire .
the mysore , which replaced stealth frigate ins tabar in november-end , immediately launched a helicopter and began closing in on the vessel .
upon sighting the chopper , the pirates abandoned their plans to hijack the vessel .
instead , navy sources said , they tied their skiffs ( speedboats ) to the mother vessel and pretended to be fishermen .
the mother vessel , a 10-metre craft called salahaddin , had some catch stocked in it to give the impression that it was a fishing vessel .
the mysore intercepted the mother vessel and fired ahead of it to prevent the pirates from getting away .
sources said the marine commandos had sighted pirates carrying rocket-propelled grenade launchers and automatic weapons .
as mysore engaged the pirates , the commandos boarded the salahaddin and arrested the pirates , who decided not to hold out as they were no match for the indian warship .
the navy recovered seven ak-47 assault rifles , rpg launchers , three speedboats , grenades and other ammunition .
the pirates were taken onboard and would be handed over to authorities in djibouti .
it was in november that the government authorized the navy to undertake " hot pursuit " of pirates in the territorial waters of somalia , which descended into anarchy in 1991 .
a country 's territorial waters extend to 12 nautical miles from shore .
the navy has been carrying out anti-piracy patrols in the international waters off the gulf of aden since october 23 to " protect indian sea-borne trade , instill confidence in the seafaring community and act as a deterrent for pirates . " .
" hot pursuit " empowers the navy to temporarily violate the maritime border of somalia to pursue pirates .
this marks the fourth success of the navy against pirates after it launched anti-piracy patrols .
on november 19 , tabar sank a somalian pirate vessel after being threatened with disastrous consequences .
a few days before that , the same warship foiled two hijack attempts in the gulf of aden -- - the world 's most dangerous waters for commercial shipping .
it rescued an indian flagship and a saudi arabian merchant vessel .
