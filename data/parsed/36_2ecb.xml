the men were arrested this morning , said sgt. tim shields , a media relations officer for the rcmp .
their first court appearance is scheduled for creston provincial court on jan. 21 .
oler , accused of having two wives , is charged with " practicing polygamy " between nov. 1 , 2004 , and oct. 8 , 2008 .
blackmore , alleged to have 19 wives , is charged with " practicing polygamy " between may 1 , 2005 , and dec. 8 , 2006 .
oppal said a special prosecution into allegations of criminal misconduct in the community of bountiful , a self-named community near creston , led to the arrests .
" the arrests are the culmination of an intensive , seven-month charge assessment review by special prosecutor terrence robertson , " who explored whether the men were in " a conjungal relationship with more than one individual at a time , " oppal said .
he stressed the prosecution is independent of the criminal justice branch and the government of british columbia , pointing out robertson is an independent special prosecutor .
he declined to comment on the specifics of the case .
rcmp officers in creston began investigating allegations of polygamy and sexual exploitation in bountiful in the fall of 2005 , shields said in a statement .
the community , with a population of approximately 1,000 , follows the practices of the polygamous fundamentalist church of jesus christ on latter day saints .
that sect 's traditional base is hildale , utah and colorado city , arizona , but its outposts include the yearning for zion ranch in eldorado , texas .
texas officials raided the ranch last april and temporarily removed 439 children .
the canadian investigation focused on the two men in positions of authority , shields said .
it was completed in september 2006 with a report to crown counsel , which recommended charges of polygamy and sexual exploitation .
a follow-up investigation began in september and uncovered additional evidence supplied to robertson , the special prosecutor , in november .
in early december , he advised the rcmp he had approved one charge of polygamy against the two men .
the charges were sworn on tuesday .
the polygamous fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints is led president warren s. jeffs , now serving a sentence for being an accomplice to rape for conducting an underage marriage .
he faces similar charges in arizona and texas .
while the doctrine tying plural marriage to exaltation in heaven is rooted in early mormon theology , the mainstream church of jesus christ of latter-day saints disavowed polygamy in 1890 .
the issue of polygamy has fueled a long debate in canada .
after the initial probe into bountiful , attorneys said the canadian government could find no witnesses on sexual-assault allegations because investigators were told that everyone consented to the acts , and allegations of sexual exploitation of young women could not be substantiated .
