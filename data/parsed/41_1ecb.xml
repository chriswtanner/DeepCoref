israel 's assault on gaza has exacted the bloodiest toll of civilian lives yet , when the bombing of un schools being used as refugee centres and of housing killed more than 50 people , including an entire family of seven young children .
the un protested at a " complete absence of accountability " for the escalating number of civilian deaths in gaza , saying " the rule of the gun " had taken over .
doctors in gaza said more than 40 people died , including children , in what appears to be the biggest single loss of life of the campaign when israeli bombs hit al-fakhora school , in jabaliya refugee camp , while it was packed with hundreds of people who had fled the fighting .
most of those killed were in the school playground and in the street , and the dead and injured lay in pools of blood .
pictures on palestinian tv showed walls heavily marked by shrapnel and bloodstains , and shoes and shredded clothes scattered on the ground .
windows were blown out .
hours before , three young men who were cousins died when the israelis bombed asma elementary school in gaza city .
they were among 400 people who had sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in beit lahiya , in northern gaza .
abed sultan , 20 , a student , and his cousins , rawhi and hussein sultan , labourers aged 22 , died .
abed sultan 's father , samir , said the bodies were so mangled that he could not tell his son from the cousins .
" we came to the school when the israelis warned us to leave , " he said .
" we hoped it would be safe .
we were 20 in one room .
we had no electricity , no blankets , no food .
" suddenly we heard a bomb that shook the school .
windows smashed .
children started to scream .
a relative came and told me one of my sons was killed .
i found my son 's body with his two cousins .
they were cut into pieces by the shell . " .
the un was particularly incensed over targeting of the schools , because israeli forces knew they were packed with families as they had ordered them to get out of their homes with leaflet drops and loudspeakers .
it said it had identified the schools as refugee centres to the israeli military and provided gps coordinates .
israel accused hamas of using civilians as cover , and said the islamist group could stop the assault on gaza by ending its rocket attacks on israel .
the palestinian authority president , mahmoud abbas , last night delivered an impassioned plea to the un security council to act immediately to stop the israeli operation , which he described as a " catastrophe " for his people .
israel has agreed a " humanitarian corridor " to allow palestinians to get essential goods .
the rising casualty toll , more than 640 palestinians killed since the assault began 12 days ago , gave fresh impetus to diplomatic efforts .
the white house offered its first hint of concern at israel 's actions by calling on it to avoid civilian deaths .
the president-elect , barack obama , broke his silence by saying he was " deeply concerned " about civilian casualties on both sides .
he said he would have " plenty to say " about the crisis after his swearing in .
gordon brown said the middle east was facing its " darkest moment yet " but hoped a ceasefire could be arranged soon .
explaining its attack on al-fahora school , the israeli military claimed that a mortar was fired from the playground , and it responded with a single shell whichkilled known hamas fighters ; the resulting explosion was compounded because hamas " booby-trapped the school " .
two hamas militants were among the dead , both part of a rocket-launching cell .
the head of the un palestinian refugee agency , john ging , said three shells landed at the perimeter of the school .
" it was entirely inevitable if artillery shells landed in that area there would be a high number of casualties , " he said .
he said un staff vetted those palestinians who sought shelter at the school .
" so far we 've not had violations by militants of our facilities , " he said , though responding to questions he accepted there had been clashes between hamas and the israeli army in the area .
earlier in the day , ging visited gaza 's hospital and was shocked at the scale of civilian casualties .
" what you have in this hospital is the consequences of political failure and the complete absence of any accountability for actions that are being taken .
it 's the rule of the gun now , and it has to stop , " he said .
at least 12 of one family , seven children aged from one to 12 , three women and two men , were killed in an air strike on their house in gaza city .
nine others were believed trapped .
israel continues to insist most of those killed by its forces are hamas and islamic jihad fighters - although its assertion it is going to extraordinary lengths to target only " terrorists " has been undermined by a tank firing on a building used by israeli troops , killing four of them , on monday .
another soldier was killed yesterday as israeli forces continued their push into gaza city .
tanks and troops also moved on the southern town of khan yunis .
the invasion has yet to achieve what israel says is its goal of stopping rocket attacks .
hamas fired more than 30 into israel yesterday , one to within 20 miles of tel aviv at gadera , wounding a baby .
the de facto hamas prime minister in gaza , ismail haniyeh , issued a statement from hiding , saying that the gazans would defeat israel .
" [ israel ] has failed to force the population to surrender , " he said .
