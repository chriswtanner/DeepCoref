i confirmed yesterday that obama has offered the job and that gupta had all but officially accepted .
got it up on the web site at 2:36 p.m. , mere moments after filing the story .
cyberspeed comes in handy sometimes .
cnn , where i host a weekly program , did n't report it until 3:59 , but the blogs went crazy -- lead story on huffpost , top of drudge 's page , then the nyt and others .
gupta would n't comment to me -- while not denying the story -- but confirmed on his twitter feed that he " has been approached by the obama administration about the u.s. surgeon general 's post . " .
everyone 's digital these days .
it 's interesting that obama was so intent on recruiting him that he met with the " house call " host for 2 1/2 hours on nov. 25 .
he seems to want an administration of stars in the hillary mode .
gupta does n't have a panetta problem -- he operates inside people 's heads , after all -- and has always been drawn to health policy , since a stint in the clinton white house .
