the producers of the academy awards are counting on a mutant wolverine who is people magazine 's reigning sexiest man alive to inject some desperately needed razzle-dazzle into their annual telecast .
hugh jackman , the australian actor known to film audiences for playing a furry comic-book hero in the x-men movies , will be host of the 81st incarnation of the oscars , the academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced on friday .
abc will broadcast the awards show on feb. 22 .
its producers said they hoped to achieve multiple goals with the casting of mr. jackman .
first , there is a desire to put more movie in the annual movie business extravaganza .
jon stewart and ellen degeneres , recent hosts , are both primarily known as television stars .
laurence mark , a co-producer of the oscars telecast , with bill condon , said there was also a desire to steer clear of stand-up comedians .
" we are trying to get away from this late-night talk show rut , " mr. mark said in a telephone interview .
" it seemed to us that we needed to turn a corner and get somebody who is , imagine that , a movie star . " .
mr. jackman 's selection is also an attempt to play to the audience at home , which has been shrinking in recent years .
viewers of the ceremony are overwhelmingly female - the oscars are known in the advertising world as the super bowl for women - and producers clearly expect mr. jackman to turn out that demographic in droves .
" it certainly did not escape us that hugh looks terrific in a tuxedo , " mr. mark said .
with any luck , a host plucked from within the movie industry 's own ranks - and less emphasis on stand-up comedy , which has often been at the expense of people sitting in the audience - will also play well inside the kodak theater .
in recent years the crowd of movie insiders has seemed to respond to hosts with notable coldness .
a representative for mr. jackman said he was walking a red carpet in berlin on behalf of his current film , the epic " australia , " and was unavailable for an interview .
deadlinehollywooddaily.com first reported his selection on the web .
mr. jackman , 40 , has never been nominated for an oscar but has artistic credibility , an important credential for the m.c. of the film awards show .
he has won positive reviews for turns in films like " the prestige " and " kate and leopold . " .
he won a tony award in 2004 for his role in the musical " the boy from oz . " .
he also has experience as an awards show m.c. , winning an emmy in 2005 for his appearance as host of the tonys .
he presided over that ceremony three times .
the oscars are a very different phenomenon from the tonys .
the film honors are an awkward hybrid - a telecast about the movies set in a theater - that require their host to oscillate between jocular chitchat and solemn introductions , while sprinkling in just the right amount of self-deprecation .
serving as host of the three-hour live show requires physical stamina and an ability to hold up under the emotional pressure of knowing that the television audience , while diminished in the united states , numbers several hundred million worldwide .
this year mr. jackman will have the added pressure of serving as the ringmaster of a lavish self-congratulation-a-thon at a time of global economic crisis .
preparing for the job may prove difficult , since producers will most likely need to draw up contingency plans in the event of a screen actors guild strike .
the union , at loggerheads with studios over contract issues big and small , said on wednesday that it would ask its members to authorize a strike .
the union , which will announce the results of the vote in late january , sees its power to wreak havoc with the oscars as prime leverage .
the telecast has come under harsh criticism in recent years as a lumbering snore that takes itself too seriously and lacks spontaneity .
star wattage has dimmed , with many members of the a list refusing to attend unless they are nominated or have a coming film to promote .
a trend toward honoring small , independent movies that most people have not seen has dented viewership .
ratings for last year 's oscars plunged to a record low , with about 32 million people tuning in , compared with 55.3 million a decade ago .
mr. condon and mr. mark , who recently served as the creative team behind the movie " dreamgirls , " are trying to energize the telecast partly by making the ceremony more of a party that celebrates movies in general , not just the elite few selected by academy voters .
" we are still at the preliminary conversation stage about what hugh wants to do , but his theatrical talent certainly does give us reason to do at least one musical number , " mr. mark said .
