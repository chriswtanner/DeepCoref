can eds remain vendor-neutral under hp' s thumb ?
will eds remain open-minded about obtaining products and services from other vendors ?
industry analysts contacted by eweek generally say they believe that hewlett-packard 's forthcoming $ 13.9 billion acquisition of electronic data systems ? announced officially on may 13 is a good move for both companies , although there will be the usual integration snafus over vendor neutrality issues , business lines , culture shock and layoffs .
analysts have also said it is a good move overall for customers and potential customers , because the combined company will offer them a greater palette of products and services from which to choose .
a combined hp-eds will certainly put a new kind of pressure on it services leader ibm .
ibm 's $ 54 billion-per-year global services arm-by far the largest in the world-will start to feel the heat from the combined hp-eds entity , which will start out at a net worth of $ 38 billion per year .
for high-end enterprise it services before this merger , the market consisted of ibm and everybody else .
it swiss army knife is all can openers .
the biggest unanswered question on people 's minds involved vendor neutrality for eds and its current customers .
eds for years was a sort of it swiss army knife in that it used whatever products and services from other vendors were needed to complete its job correctly and within budget constraints .
with its impending new ownership by one of those key vendors , that picture may change .
" we do n't know what will happen with eds ' vendor neutrality , " rick sturm , founder and president of enterprise management associates , told eweek .
overall , my take is that this transaction sounds great in theory , but there many potential pitfalls .
this is one of them .
for example , eds has largely standardized on management software from ca .
will they migrate to hp software now ?
that would take a long time and a lot of money , " sturm said .
" on the other hand , it does n't make sense to help support a competitor with license and maintenance fees .
that is just one small point regarding neutrality . " .
eds , in fact , has a large current contract with ca for network and systems management in direct competition to hp 's openview .
ca had no immediate comment may 13 .
at least initially , sturm said , there will be little noticeable impact on customers from the deal .
" there will probably be some service impacts once the organizations truly merge and consolidate resources , " he said .
" [ hp cio ] randy mott has been driving data center consolidation and standardization .
i expect that effort will be renewed with eds .
disruptions are inevitable with such migrations . " .
