microsoft : ie zero day flaw affects all versions .
microsoft said today that attackers are exploiting a previously unknown , unpatched vulnerability in all supported versions of its internet explorer web browser .
the company said it is working on an official patch to plug the security hole , but in the meantime it has released a stopgap fix to help protect affected customers .
microsoft said it is aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit the vulnerability ( cve - 2013 - 3893 ) in ie 8 and ie 9 versions of the default windows browser .
according to an advisory issued today , the flaw is a remote code bug , which means malware or miscreants could use it install malware just by coaxing ie users to browse a hacked or malicious web site .
the fix it solution is available from this link .
to apply it , click the fix it icon above the fix this problem link .
applying this solution may limit some functionalities of ie , so if you run into problems after applying this interim patch , you can click the fix it icon to the right of that " enable " button to reverse the update .
update : as several readers have already noted in the comments , this fix it solution is for 32 - bit versions of ie only .
in 64 - bit windows , you can tell whether the browser you " re using is a 32 - bit or 64 - bit version by opening the windows task manager ( ctrl+shift+esc ) and clicking the processes tab .
the number that appears after the process name ( in this case , iexplore . exe ) indicates the version in use .
