indian naval forces came to the rescue of a merchant vessel under attack by pirates in the gulf of aden on saturday , capturing 23 of the raiders , india said .
india 's ins mysore and its armed helicopter were on anti-piracy patrol when they received a distress call from the ethiopian-flagged mv gibe saying two boats were closing in and firing , a defence ministry statement said .
" on sighting the helicopter and mysore , the boats disengaged from mv gibe and attempted escape .
mysore closed the vessels and ordered them to stop . " .
indian commandos boarded the larger pirate boat , seizing 12 somali and 11 yemeni nationals as well as arms and equipment , the statement said .
a surge in piracy this year in the busy gulf of aden and indian ocean off somalia has driven up insurance costs , earned the gangs tens of millions of dollars in ransoms , and prompted foreign navies to rush to the area to protect shipping .
several international naval operations are under way off somalia , including a nato anti-piracy mission .
the indian navy in november said it had sunk the somali pirate " mother ship " , though an anti-piracy watchdog later said the vessel was actually a thai ship carrying fishing equipment that was being hijacked .
somalia has seen continuous conflict since 1991 and its weak western-backed government is still fighting islamist insurgents .
the chaos has helped fuel the explosion in piracy .
there have been nearly 100 attacks in somali waters this year .
pirates holding about a dozen ships and nearly 300 crewmen in safe havens on the somali coast .
among the captured vessels are a saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million of crude oil , the sirius star , and a ukrainian cargo ship carrying some 30 soviet-era tanks , the mv faina .
