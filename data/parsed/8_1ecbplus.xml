may 5 , 2010 .
a firebomb attack on a bank in greece killed at least three people today as police fought pitched battles with striking protesters furious at brutal budget cuts designed to avoid national bankruptcy .
hooded youths hurled petrol bombs at stores and businesses in the centre of the capital , athens , and demonstrators tried to storm parliament during the general strike , as the rioting spread to the northern city of thessaloniki .
police said two women and one man died at a branch of the marfin bank which caught fire after hooded youths broke a window and hurled petrol bombs inside .
around 20 more people had to be ushered to safety .
at least two other buildings , one used by tax officials , caught fire in other firebomb attacks on the margins of the protests .
athens underground stations were shut and the international airport deserted as tens of thousands of union members rallied on the eve of a vote in parliament on the planned cuts and tax rises .
the general strike was the first major test of the socialist government's resolve to push through unprecedented measures since agreeing an ? 110 billion ( dh472 . 72bn ) debt bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund at the weekend .
prime minister george papandreou's insistence that the measures are vital for the nation's survival failed to dissuade unions from paralysing public transport and preventing ferries from leaving docks .
after rallying in two separate demonstrations in central athens , members of the main unions began converging on parliament , where the government was preparing for the measures to be voted on thursday .
"they're taking everything from me , i don't know how i'm going to get by , " said 61 - year - old anargyros bizianis , a municipal worker in the athens suburb of piraeus who earns ? 900 ( dh4 , 275 ) a month .
as the protesters tried to break through a police line in front of parliament , they first hurled stones and bottles of water , prompting the riot squad officers to fire back with tear gas .
full - scale clashes soon then erupted outside the building , with riot police trying to disperse the crowds with baton - charges .
during the unrest , one protester threw a petrol bomb .
youths also went on the rampage in other parts of the capital , with several dozen youths hurling petrol bombs at stores and banks , and smashing shop windows and bus shelters with iron bars .
athens police chiefs mobilised all their forces , including those not on active duty , by declaring a general state of alert .
the protesters in thessaloniki targeted stores and banks in the city centre before they were dispersed by anti - riot police .
a group of about 200 communists had stormed the athens acropolis yesterday , unfurling banners reading "peoples of europe , rise up . " .
the head of the million - member strong gsee private sector union , giannis panagopoulos , said : "the greek people have been called to make sacrifices while the rich pay nothing . " .
a government official downplayed the unrest saying that "for years there's been strikes and protests in this country without much consequence . " .
but markets reacted to the violence with alarm as greek stocks plunged 5 . 4 per cent .
the government , pushed to the brink of default , agreed at the weekend to slash spending and jack up taxes in return for ? 110bn in loans over three years from eurozone countries and the international monetary fund .
among the major measures , the government is to cut 13th and 14th month bonus pay for civil servants and retirees ; require three years more for pension contributions ; and raise the retirement age for women to 65 , the same level as men .
after months of hesitation , eurozone countries and the imf agreed to lend greece billions of euros at below market rates after concerns that the athens government's debt crisis could trigger a knock - on effect elsewhere .
the german chancellor , angela merkel , fighting accusations of holding up the bailout , said today that the greek crisis underlined the need for an overhaul of the eu's fiscal rules .
"the future of europe and the future of germany within europe is at stake , " she told a debate on berlin's decision to lend ? 22 . 4bn to greece .
