the indian navy says it has arrested 23 somali and yemeni pirates who tried to storm a ship in the gulf of aden .
a navy spokesman said it had responded to a mayday call from mv gibe , flying under the ethiopian flag .
several countries have warships patrolling the gulf amid growing international concern about piracy .
meanwhile , us defence secretary robert gates said better intelligence was needed for a land attack on pirate bases to be considered .
mr gates , speaking at a security conference in bahrain , also called for shipping companies to do more to protect their vessels travelling through the arabian sean and indian ocean .
the indian government said in a statement that the captured pirates had a cache of arms and equipment , including seven ak-47 assault rifles , three machine guns , and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher .
the pirates would be handed over to the appropriate authorities , the statement added .
last month , india 's navy said it had sunk a pirate " mother vessel " off somalia .
but it later emerged that the vessel was actually a thai fishing trawler that had been seized by pirates off yemen .
mr gates told the security conference .
" the need for increased maritime security and potentially new and better means of co-operation has been highlighted by the recent high-profile acts of piracy off the coast of somalia and in the gulf of aden .
robert gates called for companies to protect their ships better .
" as with terrorism , piracy is a problem that has serious international implications and should be of particular concern to any nation that depends on the seas for commerce . " .
mr gates said most ships could outrun the pirates and they should take more preventative measures , like pulling up their ladders when at sea and perhaps placing armed guards on board .
when asked by the bbc if the us intended to attack the pirates ' land bases , mr gates replied that the us and its allies would first need to acquire better intelligence on who is behind the ongoing attacks on shipping .
he said he believed that just two or three somali clans were responsible and that the individuals involved needed to be targeted accurately to avoid killing innocent civilians .
