the interior department yesterday finalized rules changing the way it administers the endangered species act , enabling other government agencies to decide on their own whether a project would harm an imperiled species without an independent scientific review .
interior secretary dirk kempthorne called the move " a clarification " he considered essential in order to narrow the law 's reach .
" the rule strengthens the regulations so the government can focus on protecting endangered species as it strives to rebuild the american economy , " kempthorne said , adding that agencies can bypass a review by either the fish and wildlife service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration only " in specific and limited instances where an action is not anticipated to harass , harm or kill a protected species . " .
dale hall , who directs the fish and wildlife service , said the change did not mean that agencies could build dams , roads or other projects without taking into account the consequences .
" the agency still has the full responsibility to make that decision and to defend that decision , " hall said , noting that the loss of an imperiled species , known as " take , " carries legal penalties .
" they 're still liable for take , if take occurs . " .
hall said he was initially concerned about " the compressed time frame " in which the agency pushed through the rule change , which was unveiled in august , but he added that he did n't " see any harm " in kempthorne 's final decision .
interior went ahead with the rule change one day after the environmental protection agency dropped two other controversial rules changes , saying they had come along too late in president bush 's term. white house spokesman tony fratto said the reason was that the administration had " publicly and clearly stated our intention " to enact the endangered species measure well before a self-imposed deadline on eleventh-hour rule changes .
the agency received nearly 235,000 comments on the endangered species proposal , at least 208,000 of which were form letters decrying the rule .
congressional democrats and environmentalists sharply criticized the administration for the interior department action .
" as the bush administration fades off into the sunset , it continues to take brazen pot shots at everything in sight , including america 's landmark conservation law , the endangered species act , " said house resources committee chairman nick j. rahall ii ( d-w.va. ) , who said he would introduce legislation seeking to overturn the rule next year .
separately yesterday , interior issued a finding limiting the protections that could be invoked to protect polar bears , which were listed as a threatened species this year , on the grounds that the bears are already protected under the marine mammals protection act .
the finding means that the bears ' protected status could not be used to block activities such as oil and gas development outside their alaska habitat .
" we do not believe the science is there to make the causal link between activities in the lower 48 to the take of a polar bear , " kempthorne said .
" to finally admit that the science compels the listing of the polar bear as threatened due to global warming , but then deny it the protections the endangered species act should provide , is nothing other than irresponsible and shameful , " said jamie rappaport clark , executive vice president of the advocacy group defenders of wildlife , adding that her group would sue to overturn the rule .
