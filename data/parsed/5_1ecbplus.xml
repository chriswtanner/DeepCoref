billy king spun the 76ers' head coach revolving door again yesterday , pushing out jim o'brien after just one season and bringing in maurice cheeks , the popular former sixers player and assistant coach , as o'brien's replacement .
nearly three weeks after the sixers ended their season , king decided to fire o'brien , who still has two years and $8 million left on the contract he signed when he was hired by the sixers on april 21 , 2004 .
cheeks , who was fired march 2 as head coach of the portland trail blazers , is the fourth head coach since king took over as the team's president and general manager on may 26 , 2003 .
that is the same date that larry brown resigned from the sixers after six seasons , the last time coaching stability existed with the team .
cheeks was a second - round draft choice of the 76ers in 1978 and played for 11 seasons with the team .
he was the point guard and floor leader of the sixers' 1983 nba title team .
at a news conference last night at the philadelphia college of osteopathic medicine , king said he had the support of ed snider , the chairman of comcast - spectacor , the team's owner , for his latest moves even though the sixers will be paying ex - coaches randy ayers ( $2 million ) and o'brien along with cheeks next season .
"in talking with ed , we felt the main focus was that we want to make the right decisions and not let money be the factor , " king said .
"we think we owe it to our fans and the city of philadelphia to do that . " .
cheeks , 48 , a four - time nba all - star while with the sixers , was fired from the blazers , his first head coaching job , in the middle of his fourth season .
he led the team to a 162 - 139 record .
two years ago , after brown resigned , king looked to cheeks to take over as brown's successor .
but the trail blazers rebuffed him three times , because cheeks was still under contract to them .
the sixers then hired ayers , who lasted 52 games before being replaced by chris ford .
king said he decided on saturday to fire o'brien , and then checked with cheeks to see if he'd be interested in the job .
cheeks said he would be , and king called him again yesterday and reached a deal after notifying o'brien of his decision .
terms of the deal were not disclosed .
when king hired o'brien , he had called him a "perfect fit" for the job .
o'brien did lead the sixers to a 43 - 39 record - a 10 - win improvement over the previous season - and a playoff berth and coached allen iverson to his fourth nba scoring title .
but in evaluating the season , king said he didn't think the sixers were heading in the right direction .
he had a problem with the team's style of play , which included reliance on the three - point basket and a defense that protected the paint but had trouble getting out on perimeter shooters .
there was also talk that o'brien was aloof and not communicative with his players .
he did not start samuel dalembert , a developing young center , until the season's 19th game , and he did not play willie green with iverson for much of the season's final four months because he felt that was a bad matchup defensively .
king said that in his postseason meetings with players , "not one of them said they wouldn't play for jim . . .
that they'd all come back ready to go and try to go further in the playoffs . " .
but other things bothered him .
king said he didn't want to make a snap decision when the season ended on may 3 , the day that the detroit pistons eliminated the sixers from the playoffs .
he talked to his management team , went on vacation for a week , then made his decision on saturday .
"in the interview process with jim , there were a lot of things that we talked about , " king said .
"but in watching the season , evaluating our young players' development and evaluating our style of play , it wasn't something i was comfortable with . " .
reached by telephone yesterday , o'brien declined to comment .
"i'm not going to have any discussion about this , " he said .
king said that when he broke the news yesterday to o'brien , "he asked why , and i told him that i just felt there were some things that took place that i don't think will change and we're going to make a change .
he said , 'thank you . ' " .
snider , who attended king's news conference , said he backed king .
"i really don't question billy at all , " he said .
"i know what went on in the process when he made this decision , as well as the decision to hire jim o'brien .
i've supported his moves , and i still do . " .
o'brien was excited to come back to philadelphia because of his roots in the city .
cheeks , who is expected to speak at a press conference today , is excited to be coming back to philadelphia because of all the success he enjoyed here as a player , followed by seven seasons as an assistant coach .
"mo is family , " king said .
"mo bleeds 76ers .
he bleeds philadelphia . " .
he is still the franchise's all - time leader in assists and steals .
cheeks also played with san antonio , new york , atlanta and new jersey before retiring in 1993 .
cheeks returned to the sixers in 1994 as an assistant coach and stayed for seven seasons until the trail blazers hired him as head coach on june 27 , 2001 .
under cheeks' guidance , the blazers made the playoffs in 2002 and 2003 , but did not get out of the first round .
they missed the postseason in 2004 , breaking a streak of 21 consecutive years in the playoffs , and were wracked by dissension .
"i look at mo cheeks and i know mo cheeks , " king said .
"if players have problems with mo cheeks , then there's got to be something wrong with those players . " .
under o'brien , the former head coach of the boston celtics , iverson moved from shooting guard to point guard and responded with an mvp - caliber season , winning his fourth nba scoring title .
but o'brien is gone now .
cheeks is in .
and king knows he's being held accountable .
"i look in the mirror every day , " king said .
"i'm not somebody that's above scrutiny , but i think i try to do the best i can and make the best decisions . " .
