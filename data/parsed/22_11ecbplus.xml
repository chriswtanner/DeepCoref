female employee yvonne hiller kills two in kraft shooting .
in a sad and surprising reversal of gender roles , a disgruntled woman opened fire at a kraft factory in philadelphia last night , killing two workers and wounding two others .
the shooting happened moments after the employee , yvonne hiller , was suspended from her job at kraft , where she " d worked for 15 years , the daily news reports .
after being escorted from the snack plant , she re - entered 10 minutes later with a handgun .
about 100 people were in the building when she began shooting .
hiller was taken into custody after a standoff with the swat team .
a kraft representative confirmed hiller is now in police custody and that one of the wounded employees is in the hospital .
" this is a sad time for the kraft foods family , " a statement reads .
" we are working closely with the authorities as they investigate this situation , and our facility is closed until further notice . " .
unfortunately , the most surprising aspect of this incident is the shooter " s gender .
women shooters are rare but may be on the rise .
