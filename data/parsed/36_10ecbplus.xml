polygamist prophet warren jeffs charged againjuly 23 , 2008 . 4 : 49 pm .
seven indictments , nine charges and six leaders of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints now face trial in texas .
among them is flds prophet warren jeffs , who has already been convicted in utah on two counts of being an accomplice to the rape of a 14 - year - old girl and is now awaiting trial on similar charges in arizona .
the flds also has followers living in bountiful , b . c . bountiful has been the object of scrutiny by the rcmp and the b . c . attorney general since 2004 .
a special prosecutor , terry robertson , was appointed in june to determine whether charges should be laid .
the texas grand jury heard evidence collected during the april raid on the eldorado compound that resulted in more than 400 women and children being taken into protective custody .
they were later allowed to return to the compound after a texas appeal court ruled that the child protection officials had overstepped their legal boundaries .
the grand jury also heard testimony from at least four flds women including prophet warren jeffs's 16 - year - old daughter who her father placed into a religious marriage to an older man when she was just 15 .
the texas charge against jeffs is a first - degree felony count of sexually assaulting an under - aged girl .
the other men - none of whom have yet been named - face charges related to sexual assault of under - aged girls and bigamy .
jeffs will not be tried in texas until he goes to court in arizona .
matt smith , the county attorney in mohave county , az . said in a press release wednesday that he had heard about the charges , but "the indictments in texas do not affect the arizona case at all . " .
the americans have taken a very different approach to the flds .
in utah , arizona and texas , the main thrust of the investigation has been the sexual abuse of under - aged girls .
in british columbia , attorney - general wally oppal has focused his attention mainly on the criminal code offence of polygamy .
