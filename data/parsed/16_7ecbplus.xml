deputy's alleged killer held .
a 27 - year - old parolee is found 'cowering in a bathtub' near the house where jerry ortiz had been shot in the head a few hours earlier .
june 26 , 2005 .
before he was fatally shot , los angeles county sheriff's deputy jerry ortiz was looking for a man considered to be a "career criminal" and was hoping to arrest him on suspicion of attempted murder , officials said saturday .
that man , jose luis orozco , is now the main suspect in the friday afternoon slaying of ortiz in hawaiian gardens .
orozco was arrested around midnight friday by a sheriff's swat team , three houses from the scene of the fatal shooting .
he was found "cowering in a bathtub , " sheriff lee baca said .
ortiz , a gang enforcement officer , was searching for orozco because he was a suspect in a shooting that occurred in the neighborhood monday , said sheriff's capt . ray peavy , a homicide investigator .
orozco , 27 , a known gang member , was also suspected of violating parole after serving time for a weapons violation , peavy said .
ortiz , 35 , was on his own about 3 p . m . friday when he went to a house in hawaiian gardens , a working - class city at the northeast border of long beach with long - standing gang problems .
peavy said the specific reason for ortiz's visit was unknown but he provided a few details about the encounter : a woman answered the door and a man walked up behind her .
ortiz asked the man for some identification and was checking it when orozco appeared from inside the house .
he shot ortiz once in the head and fled , peavy said .
dozens of law enforcement officers worked the case through the afternoon and into the night , fanning out around the 12200 block of 223rd street and questioning residents .
deputies believed they knew where orozco was hiding and obtained a search warrant .
a handgun was recovered during the arrest , peavy said .
orozco , who was booked on suspicion of violating his parole , is being held without bail .
los angeles county dist . atty . steve cooley said he expected orozco to be charged with first - degree murder of a peace officer , which means he could receive the death penalty if he is convicted .
peavy could not say what orozco was doing in the house , but said he had been living on the street and sleeping in different places .
baca , who had been in kentucky for a meeting of the national sheriffs' assn . , returned to los angeles for a news conference held saturday with cooley and los angeles mayor - elect antonio villaraigosa .
baca praised the work of his investigators , but the arrest seemed to do little to quell his anger .
he called orozco "the scum of the earth" and an "idiot , " pointing to a photo of the suspect and the "devil horns" tattooed on his bald head .
cooley unfurled a long trail of printer paper that baca said contained orozco's criminal record , including drug and weapon violations , resisting arrest , burglary and assault with a deadly weapon .
the sheriff contrasted the suspect's life with that of ortiz , a 15 - year department veteran .
ortiz "not only exemplified the best of what we have , but took it upon himself to work in the toughest job that we also have - - and that is trying to do something about this out - of - control gang problem in los angeles county , " baca said .
baca urged everyone in southern california to pay more attention to the gang problem .
he called for broader prevention initiatives , lamented the lack of resources in his department and urged parents to get involved in the lives of their children .
cooley said the fact that orozco hadn't been in contact with his parole officer since january was a "failure" of the system , but he did not elaborate .
undersheriff larry waldie said that ortiz set out without a partner friday because he had arrived early and was eager to get to work .
peavy said ortiz usually partnered with one of two deputies , but both had the day off .
instead , ortiz had planned to partner with his sergeant .
but he apparently decided to visit the house first .
peavy noted that such solo work is not a violation of department policy .
ortiz , of diamond bar , was an army veteran and the father of two boys , ages 6 and 16 .
he was married for the second time about two weeks ago .
his family declined a request for an interview saturday through a sheriff's spokesman .
but colleagues described him as someone who lived for police work and was a "fanatic" about boxing .
he fought on the sheriff's boxing team and trained recruits and deputies in hand - to - hand combat .
lt . bob rifkin of operation safe streets , the department's gang unit , said ortiz became interested in the gang problem while working as a patrol officer from 1996 to 2000 .
he joined the gang unit in 2001 after passing a background check and written exam that tested his knowledge of gang culture .
ortiz won numerous commendations for his work .
last year , he was awarded the city of lakewood's medal of valor after he fatally shot a carjacker who drew a gun on him and his partner .
"jerry was 35 years old and had more motivation than a 21 - year - old just getting on the department , " rifkin said .
"he always wanted to go toward the action and that's what jerry was respected for . " .
baca noted that ortiz's family has had "tremendous tragedies when it comes to those members who've been in law enforcement . " .
in january , ortiz's brother - in - law , manuel a . gonzalez , was stabbed to death while working as a corrections officer at a state prison in chino .
the alleged killer , jon christopher blaylock , was serving a life sentence for the attempted murder of a police officer .
