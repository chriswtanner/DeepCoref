creighton's doug mcdermott returns for senior season .
doug mcdermott " s teammates figured it was just another day in the gym wednesday afternoon .
they were playing pick - up games with a guy they didn " t know for sure would be around next season .
but mcdermott had a secret .
shortly before hitting the court , mcdermott had told his father , creighton coach greg mcdermott , that he intended to return for his senior season rather than declare for the nba draft .
father and son then informed creighton athletic director bruce rasmussen .
doug called his mom to break the news to her , then stepped into the gym to play a little ball .
" he wasn " t acting any different , " grant gibbs said .
" business as usual . " .
later that night , mcdermott let the news slip to a couple of them .
" i had to go to class today , knowing that he was going to announce it , and try to be super low - key , " jahenns manigat said .
" but i couldn " t stop smiling . " .
it " s safe to assume bluejay nation had much the same reaction when , shortly before 2 p . m . , mcdermott sent out the following message on twitter .
" i will be returning to creighton for my senior year and can " t wait to put on that uniform for one more season . " .
mcdermott " s return for his senior season will allow a fan base that has come to marvel at his on - court accomplishments the past three seasons one more chance to watch him .
college basketball insiders see his return possibly giving creighton more of a fighting chance as it moves into the new big east .
for mcdermott , it will give him a chance to make more of an orderly transition from college basketball to professional basketball .
he knows he " s taking a risk from a financial standpoint .
" that " s definitely a lot of money i " m passing down , but that money could be there next year , " mcdermott told reporters thursday .
" it might not be quite as much , but you really can " t put a price tag on a senior year . " .
that was the same theme that mcdermott touched on repeatedly wednesday night in an exclusive interview with the world - herald .
in the final analysis , mcdermott " s heart won out over the cash .
" my heart has been telling me all along to stay , but my mind tried to take over a couple of times , " mcdermott said .
" i just ended up trusting myself that i was making the right decision . " .
his mind , of course , focused on the financial benefits that might be his had he decided to turn professional .
based on evaluations he received from the nba draft advisory committee , mcdermott said , " there was no doubt in my mind that i would have been a first - round pick . " .
that would have meant a two - year , guaranteed contract that could have been worth between a minimum of $888 , 600 to $1 . 4 million if he had been selected with one of the last 15 picks in the lower half of the first round .
that initially had his father recommending that his son turn pro .
" he knew my dream is to play in the nba , and he just felt that this was too good of an opportunity to pass up , " doug said .
" but the way i look at it , if i can play in the nba , i can play there the next year just as well as i can next year .
" i feel there are things i can work on .
i feel i can still improve my draft stock by playing in the big east .
there are a lot of areas that i can get better at , and i just felt i " d be more comfortable doing it here in omaha . " .
mcdermott had heard more than once from outsiders that he should turn pro because he had nothing left to prove as a collegian .
the 6 - foot - 8 , 225 - pound forward has been a consensus first - team all - american in each of the past two seasons .
he broke creighton " s career scoring record near the end of the last season .
that argument might have swayed some players , but if there is anything mcdermott has shown the past three seasons it " s that he " s an unconventional superstar .
he remains as unassuming as the day he stepped on campus in june 2010 .
he embraces the attention from an adoring fan base that some players might find stifling .
it " s that fan base , mcdermott said , that figured prominently into his decision .
" i care so much about creighton , " he said .
" there are a lot of people around here that believed in me .
this whole fan base has been with me from the start .
i felt like i owed them one more year . " .
mcdermott said the opportunity to play in the new conference became more of a factor as he got deeper into the decision - making process .
he admitted had creighton remained in the missouri valley it might have made it easier to turn pro .
but the opportunity to play in the big east , and perhaps prove a few people wrong , was too much to pass up .
" i feel there are a lot of people that don " t believe we can be successful in the big east , " mcdermott said .
" if you ask anyone on our team , we feel that we " re going to be capable of doing some damage there .
" that played into my decision a lot .
i care for the guys in this program and i care for the coaches .
i wanted to do what i could to help make this transition a successful one . " .
what didn " t factor into his decision , he said , was the fear that he would be leaving his dad in a tight spot had he bolted for the nba .
as greg mcdermott said thursday , his son " s 23 points and eight rebounds a game will come in handy next season .
but doug said his father and creighton would have been fine had he decided to leave .
" he never pushed for me to stay , " doug said .
in an interview with the world - herald on tuesday , mcdermott indicated he might remain undecided until sunday " s deadline to declare for the draft .
the agony of the decision - making process was apparent as he spoke .
he clearly was undecided .
in discussing his decision wednesday night , mcdermott said he never intended to take so long in making up his mind .
" i apologize for putting people through that , " he said .
in trying to make up his mind , mcdermott said , he put his emotions to a test .
he would go through one day with the idea in mind that he was headed for the nba .
the next day , he would approach things as if he would be returning to creighton .
" i wanted to see how i felt , " mcdermott said .
" i found myself waking up the next day feeling a whole lot better when i was thinking about coming back .
but i went back and forth more times than you can imagine . " .
he said tuesday that he had talked with former creighton all - american kyle korver , now in his 10th season in the nba .
mcdermott also sought the counsel of harrison barnes , his former teammate at ames high school who now is wrapping up his rookie season with the golden state warriors .
" he and i talked before the ncaa tournament , and he told me i should go to the nba if i felt i was 100 percent ready , " mcdermott said .
" that really stuck with me .
" harrison told me that playing in the nba is a completely different world .
the money is nice , but you " re out there fighting for your job every night .
it " s not like college , where you " re playing for the love of the game and for the fans . " .
in the end , those factors appealed more to mcdermott than money .
" i believe i " m going to play in the nba , but i have to do it when i feel i " m 100 percent ready , " he said .
" i feel like i have some unfinished business here at creighton .
i feel like i can be a lot better , and why not do it here where i can have fun for another year .
" i " m so relieved .
i feel like a ton of weight has been lifted off my shoulders .
i can " t put into words how happy i am this is behind me and how excited i am to be coming back .
this just feels right . " .
