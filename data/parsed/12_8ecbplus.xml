a five - boat pirate attack on merchant vessels transiting the gulf of aden was foiled by an indian warship that was on escort duty , capturing 26 somani brigands on three of the skiffs and confiscating their weapons , a naval officer said here friday .
patrol vessel ins sukanya was escorting the five merchant vessels through the internationally recognised transit corridor in the gulf of aden thursday morning when the warship's crew noticed the five - boat pirate formation approaching the cargo ship group .
"the warship immediately altered towards the suspicious vessels and challenged them , " the officer said , adding the pirate skiffs then reversed course and tried to flee the area .
"while two of the skiffs and its crew managed to get away , sukanya successfully intercepted the remaining three skiffs and carried out well - practiced and professionally executed boarding - and - search action .
"the three boats had a total of 26 somali crew on board .
during the operation , six ak - 47 rifles , 12 magazines and about 300 rounds of ammunition were found and confiscated , " the officer said .
in addition , the naval boarding party also found a host of other equipment such as grapnels , ladders and rope - handling gloves , all of which confirmed their intent to attack and hijack the merchant vessels , he said .
this anti - piracy action by ins sukanya was the fifth successful operation by its crew during its current patrol mission in the gulf of aden since september this year .
ins sukanya has seized a total of 14 ak - 47 rifles , 31 magazines and 923 rounds of ammunition during the five operations it carried out there , the officer said .
