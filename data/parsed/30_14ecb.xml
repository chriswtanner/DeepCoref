internet service in egypt , the uae , india and other counties in the region was interrupted today when submarine cables in the mediterranean sea failed .
cause of the failure is not known at this time , says operator reliance globalcom .
a total of three cables linking italy and egypt went down .
a ship has been sent out to fix the problems .
currently , services are being rerouted to backup cables and satellites .
as rerouting measures fully kick in , services are expected to improve by early saturday morning .
this is n't the first time that cable service to the region has failed .
earlier this year , five separate undersea cables were cut between late january and early february , interrupting service to a number of countries .
there 's likely to be some serious failure analysis involved if we see some more pipes go off-line in the next week .
