mark felt , watergate 's 'deep throat , ' dies at 95 .
w. mark felt , the former fbi second-in-command who revealed himself as " deep throat " 30 years after he tipped off reporters to the watergate scandal that toppled a president , has died .
he was 95 .
felt died thursday in santa rosa after suffering from congestive heart failure for several months , said family friend john d. o'connor , who wrote the 2005 vanity fair article uncovering felt 's secret .
the shadowy central figure in the one of the most gripping political dramas of the 20th century , felt insisted his alter ego be kept secret when he leaked damaging information about president richard nixon and his aides to washington post reporter bob woodward .
while some - including nixon and his aides - speculated that felt was the source who connected the white house to the june 1972 break-in at the headquarters of the democratic national committee , he steadfastly denied the accusations until finally coming forward in may 2005 .
" i 'm the guy they used to call deep throat , " felt told o'connor for the vanity fair article , creating a whirlwind of media attention .
weakened by a stroke , the man who had kept his secret for decades was n't doing much talking - he merely waved to the media from the front door of his daughter 's santa rosa home .
critics , including those who went to prison for the watergate scandal , called him a traitor for betraying the commander in chief .
supporters hailed him as a hero for blowing the whistle on a corrupt administration trying to cover up attempts to sabotage opponents .
felt grappled with his place in history , arguing with his children over whether to reveal his identity or to take his secret to the grave , o'connor said .
he agonized about what revealing his identity would do to his reputation .
would he be seen as a turncoat or a man of honor ?
" people will debate for a long time whether i did the right thing by helping woodward , " felt wrote in his 2006 memoir , " a g-man 's life : the fbi , 'deep throat ' and the struggle for honor in washington . " .
" the bottom line is that we did get the whole truth out , and is n't that what the fbi is supposed to do ? " .
ultimately , his daughter , joan , persuaded him to go public ; .
after all , woodward was sure to profit by revealing the secret after felt died .
" we could make at least enough money to pay some bills , like the debt i 've run up for the kids ' education , " she told her father , according to the vanity fair article .
" let 's do it for the family . " .
the revelation capped a washington whodunnit that spanned more than three decades and seven presidents .
it was the final mystery of watergate , the subject of the best-selling book and hit movie " all the president 's men , " which inspired a generation of college students to pursue journalism .
it was by chance that felt came to play a pivotal role in the drama .
back in 1970 , woodward struck up a conversation with felt while both were waiting in a white house hallway .
felt apparently took a liking to the young woodward , then a navy courier , and woodward kept the relationship going , treating felt as a mentor as he tried to figure out the ways of washington .
later , while woodward and partner carl bernstein relied on various unnamed sources in reporting on watergate , the man their editor dubbed " deep throat " helped to keep them on track and confirm vital information .
the post won a pulitzer prize for its watergate coverage .
within days of the burglary at watergate that launched the post 's investigative series , woodward phoned felt .
" he reminded me how he disliked phone calls at the office but said that the watergate burglary case was going to 'heat up ' for reasons he could not explain , " woodward wrote after felt was named .
" he then hung up abruptly . " .
felt helped woodward link former cia man howard hunt to the break-in .
he said the reporter could accurately write that hunt , whose name was found in the address book of one of the burglars , was a suspect .
but felt told him off the record , insisting that their relationship and felt 's identity remain secret .
worried that phones were being tapped , felt arranged clandestine meetings worthy of a spy novel .
woodward would move a flower pot with a red flag on his balcony if he needed to meet felt .
the g-man would scrawl a time to meet on page 20 of woodward 's copy of the new york times and they would rendezvous in a suburban virginia parking garage in the dead of night .
in the movie , the enduring image of deep throat - a name borrowed from a 1972 porn movie - is of a testy , chain-smoking hal holbrook telling woodward , played by robert redford , to " follow the money . " .
in a memoir published in april 2006 , felt said he saw himself as a " lone ranger " who could help derail a white house cover-up .
felt wrote that he was upset by the slow pace of the fbi investigation into the watergate break-in and believed the press could pressure the administration to cooperate .
" from the start , it was clear that senior administration officials were up to their necks in this mess , and that they would stop at nothing to sabotage our investigation , " felt wrote in his memoir .
some critics said felt , a j. edgar hoover loyalist , was bitter at being passed over when nixon appointed an fbi outsider and confidante , l. patrick gray , to lead the fbi after hoover 's death .
gray was later implicated in watergate abuses .
" we had no idea of his motivations , and even now some of his motivations are unclear , " bernstein said .
felt wrote that he was n't motivated by anger .
" it is true that i would have welcomed an appointment as fbi director when hoover died .
it is not true that i was jealous of gray , " he wrote .
felt was born in twin falls , idaho , and worked for an idaho senator during graduate school .
after law school at george washington university he spent a year at the federal trade commission .
felt joined the fbi in 1942 and worked as a nazi hunter during world war ii .
ironically , while providing crucial information to the post , felt also was assigned to ferret out the newspaper 's source .
the investigation never went anywhere , but plenty of people , including those in the white house at the time , guessed that felt , who was leading the investigation into watergate , may have been acting as a double agent .
the watergate tapes captured white house chief of staff h.r. haldeman telling nixon that felt was the source , but they were afraid to stop him .
nixon asks : " somebody in the fbi ? " .
haldeman : " yes , sir. mark felt ... .
if we move on him , he 'll go out and unload everything .
he knows everything that 's to be known in the fbi . " .
felt left the fbi in 1973 for the lecture circuit .
five years later he was indicted on charges of authorizing fbi break-ins at homes associated with suspected bombers from the 1960s radical group the weather underground .
president ronald reagan pardoned felt in 1981 while the case was on appeal - a move applauded by nixon .
woodward and bernstein said they would n't reveal the source 's identity until he or she died , and finally confirmed felt 's role only after he came forward .
o'connor said thursday his friend appeared to be at peace since the revelation .
" what i saw was a person that went from a divided personality that carried around this heavy secret to a completely integrated and glowing personality over these past few years once he let the secret out , " he said .
felt is survived by two children , joan felt and mark felt jr. , and four grandchildren .
his wife , audrey felt , died in 1984 .
