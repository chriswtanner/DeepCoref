chargers jamal williams arrested for dui .
in the steeped nfl tradition of drinking and driving , chargers nt jamal williams is doing his part to uphold the tradition .
of course , football is the ultimate team game and fellow charger vincent jackson was arrested last month for dui as well .
although results are pending for the blood - alcohol test that williams took , he has been booked and later released on bail .
while i make fun of a topic that definitely isn't funny , i still don't understand how these players with their multi - million dollar salaries don't hire drivers or car services .
