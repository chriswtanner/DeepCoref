impact of eds merger on south charleston unclear .
it 's too early to tell what impact - if any - hewlett-packard co. 's decision to acquire electronic data systems corp. will have on eds ' operations in south charleston , an eds spokesman said .
earlier this month hewlett-packard unveiled a bid of nearly $ 14 billion bid to purchase eds .
eds has about 50 employees in building 6000 at the south charleston technology park .
the workers manage the federal department of housing and urban development 's computer network of more than 18,000 users in more than 80 locations .
eds won the 10-year contract in 2003 .
bill ritz , eds spokesman , pointed out that hewlett-packard 's acquisition of eds still needs the approval of regulators and eds ' stockholders .
" the deal is supposed to close sometime in the second half of 2008 , " ritz said .
" until it closes , both companies are competitors and it will be business as usual .
we will continue to put our customers first and serve them and help them compete in the global marketplace . " .
any cuts in staff are pure speculation at this point , ritz said .
" a lot of work still needs to be done , " he said .
" we need to let this play out and keep the focus on our customers and remember we are separate companies now . " .
