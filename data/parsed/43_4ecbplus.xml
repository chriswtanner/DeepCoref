amd buys sea micro for $334m to get into energy - efficient " microservers " .

there " s a sea change happening in a segment of the server market dubbed microservers .
and sea micro has been at the center of it , disrupting the market with energy efficient servers that use lightweight processors from intel .
advanced micro devices is acquiring sea micro today for $334 million , including $281 million in cash .
sea micro has been disruptive because it can pack a lot of computing power in a server rack that is about a sixth of the usual size .
its servers use a quarter of the usual electricity and cost a lot less .
the servers use intel " s atom microprocessors , which are targeted at energy efficient devices such as tablet computers .
but amd " s move could shake things up for intel , which presumably will lose some of its business .
the advantage of sunnyvale , calif . - based seamicro " s small and power - efficient computers is that enterprises can now shove a lot more computing power into a given amount of space and use a lot less electrical power , thereby cutting electricity bills dramatically .
that matters because electricity costs are the biggest part of the budget for operating data centers .
andrew feldman , chief executive of sea micro has said in past interviews that seamicro had become the fastest - growing system company in silicon valley history .
seamicro " s customers include france telecom , skype , rogers wireless , mozilla , eharmony , and china netcom bb .
hundreds of millions of internet users traverse seamicro " s hardware daily .
as we " ve described in earlier stories , intel has been improving its server microprocessors by making them more power efficient .
but the microprocessor only accounts for a third of the power consumption in a server .
seamicro " s innovation lies in how it attacks the remaining two - thirds of the power consumption problem .
it does so by combining a lot of the extraneous chips into a single , more - efficient custom chip , feldman said .
in its earliest system , seamicro put 384 intel atom dual - core processors ( for a total of 64 - bit 768 cores ) in a 10 - rack system , which is just 17 . 5 inches high .
the newer sm10000 - 64hd was a 20 percent improvement over seamicro " s previous server line and a 150 percent improvement on its compute density record , or the amount of computing power in a given space .
that single machine could replace rival systems with a bunch of equipment : 60 traditional servers , four rack switches , four terminal servers , and a load balancing server .
it uses a quarter of the power and a sixth of the space .
seamicro can put an entire server on a motherboard that is 5 inches by 11 inches .
since the hardware is intel - based , customers don " t have to change their software at all .
seamicro was founded in 2007 and is backed with $60 million in funding by khosla ventures , draper fisher jurvetson , crosslink capital , and a number of strategic investors .
it also won grants from the u . s . departement of energy ( $9 . 3 million ) and the state of california ( $250 , 000 ) .
seamicro has 80 employees .
most recently , it raised $20 million .
seamicro also attacked the power consumption problem with a very clever trick known as virtualization .
today , virtualization is frequently used with servers .
it is a layer of software that rests between an application and the servers that it runs on .
if an application needs only two servers , the virtualization software finds two available servers to run the application .
if the application gets busy and needs 10 servers , the virtualization software finds 10 available servers to do the job .
the application is no longer tied to specific servers ; the virtualization software frees up the overall system and gets more use out of the available servers .
seamicro did the same thing , but it applied the concept of virtualization to the inside of a server .
feldman designed custom chips that could take the tasks that were handled by everything beyond the intel microprocessor and its chip set .
the custom chips virtualize all of those other components so that it finds the resource when it " s needed .
it essentially tricks the microprocessor into thinking that the rest of the system is there when it needs it .
seamicro virtualized a lot of functions that took up a lot of space inside each server in a rack .
it also did the same with functions such as storage , networking , server management , and load balancing .
full told , seamicro eliminates 90 percent of the components from a system board .
seamicro calls this cpu / io virtualization .
with it , seamicro shrinks the size of the system board from a pizza box to the size of a credit card .
by boiling down the rest of the system into a couple of chips , seamicro can get rid of a lot of the components in a system , thereby getting rid of space , cost , and power consumption .
