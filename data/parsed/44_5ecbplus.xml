november 12 , 2007 03 : 57 pm .
hewlett - packard on monday said it has agreed to buy eyp mission critical facilities , a consulting company that specializes in data center cooling and energy efficiency .
financial terms were not disclosed .
the acquisition , expected to close by the end of january , would provide hp with proprietary services and technology related to one of the hottest issues today in data center planning and design .
because eyp services start at the ground level of data - center design , the company would give hp an early entry with its cooling technology and energy - efficient storage products .
eyp , based in new york , has 350 employees spread through 13 offices in the united states and the united kingdom .
most of its operations , employees , and management team would be folded into hp .
eyp is led by chairman steven einhorn and chief executive peter gross .
the need for more storage is growing as companies expand their businesses and strive to meet legal and regulatory requirements for handling electronic documents .
additional storage , however , also can increase energy consumption to run and cool more powerful servers .
eyp's proprietary products and services include eneropt , a software - based process to assess and benchmark energy efficiency ; a cooling design concept called cool design ; and a direct current powered facility design called dc2 .
"acquiring eyp mission critical facilities boosts hp's ability to help customers transform their data centers and build dynamic computing environments from the ground up , " john mccain , senior vp and general manager for hp services , said in a statement .
industries in which eyp has customers include financial services , technology , telecommunications , broadcast , manufacturing , and health care .
the company also serves federal , state and local government agencies .
besides the eyp deal , hp has made other data center - related acquisitions this year .
the largest was the $1 . 6 billion purchase of opsware , a maker of data center automation software ; and the $214 million buy of neoware , a maker of hardware and software for thin - client desktop systems .
