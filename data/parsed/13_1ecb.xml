an arsonist has badly damaged the church attended by the governor of alaska , sarah palin , and she has apologised if the fire was connected to " undeserved negative attention " from her failed campaign as the republican vice-presidential nominee .
no one was hurt in the fire on friday night although a handful of people , including two children , were inside the wasilla bible church , said the central mat-su fire chief , james steele .
ms palin visited the church on saturday .
her spokesman , bill mcallister , said , " whatever the motives of the arsonist , the governor has faith in the scriptural passage that what was intended for evil will in some way be used for good . " .
mr steele said the blaze was being treated as arson , but he did not know of any threats to the church .
authorities also did not know whether mrs palin 's connection to the church was relevant to the fire .
" it 's hard to say at this point .
everything is just speculation , " he said .
" we have no information on intent or motive . " .
damage to the church was estimated at $ us1 million ( $ 1.52 million ) , authorities said .
mr steele said the fire was lit at the entrance and moved inward as a small group of women were working on crafts .
a fire alarm alerted them to the fire .
firefighters fought the blaze in temperatures of minus 17 degrees .
the pastor , larry kroon , declined to say whether the church had received any recent threats .
" there are so many variables , " he said .
" i do n't want to comment in that direction . " .
the 1000-member evangelical church was the subject of scrutiny after mrs palin was named john mccain 's republican party running mate .
early in her campaign , the church was criticised for promoting a focus on the family " love won out conference " in anchorage .
it promised to " help men and women dissatisfied with living homosexually understand that same-sex attractions can be overcome " .
wasilla , mrs palin 's home town , is 64 kilometres north of anchorage .
