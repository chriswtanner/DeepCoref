greece calm after 8 days of riots by angry youths .
athens was calm sunday after eight days of the worst riots greece has seen in decades , sparked by the police killing of a teenager .
traffic returned to normal in the center of town and an open-topped double-decker bus carried tourists round the city 's main sights .
the popular cafes in the thissio area under the acropolis were busy , and couples took their young children for a sunday walk .
but greek youths who have protested daily since the boy 's death have vowed to remain on the streets until their concerns are addressed .
protesters are angry not just at the police but at an increasingly unpopular government and over economic issues .
a newspaper poll published sunday showed the governing conservatives ' popularity at a dismal 20.6 percent , 5.6 percent below the main opposition socialists .
however , 55 percent of respondents said neither party seemed competent to handle the situation .
the focus poll of 1,000 people for real news gave a 3.1 percent margin of error .
violence has wracked greece every day since the death of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos , spreading quickly from athens to more than a dozen other cities and leaving at least 70 people injured .
hundreds of stores have been smashed and looted , and more than 200 people arrested .
late saturday and early sunday , youths in athens attacked a police station , stores and banks and fought running battles with police , as candlelit vigils were held to mark a week since the shooting .
a new candlelit vigil is planned for sunday evening at the site of the shooting .
a separate protest is scheduled in western athens .
while most of the protesters have been peaceful , the tone of the demonstrations has been set by a violent fringe .
and more young people have been willing to join those fringe elements than in the past .
" in the end , the violence that we use is minimal in comparison to the violence the system uses , like the banks , " said 32-year-old protester paris kyriakides .
" speaking as an anarchist , we want to create those social conditions that will generate more uprisings and to get more people out in the streets to demand their rights . " .
in a poll released sunday , some 62 percent of respondents said the reactions to the shooting were inexcusable , compared with 35 percent who believed the violence was justified .
the poll of 1,000 people gave no margin of error .
according to another poll , greeks see more in the violence than a simple reaction to the shooting .
asked whether the riots were a social uprising , 60 percent responded yes .
some 64 percent considered police were unprepared for the violence .
the poll of 520 people published in the kathimerini newspaper gave a 4.5 percent margin of error .
