a man has been charged with first-degree murder after a shooting at an office christmas party in vancouver friday .
police allege eric allen kirkpatrick , 61 , opened fire at the tallgrass distribution ltd christmas party , killing benjamin david banky , 40 .
banky was the ceo of tallgrass distribution ltd. , a natural health products company .
at least a dozen employees had been celebrating when the gunman , who had been recently laid off , entered the party and began firing a gun , according to vancouver police spokesperson const. tim fanning .
the other partygoers managed to escape unharmed .
" the shock was tremendous but all the other people in the business - and there another dozen other people who were there for a christmas party - managed to get out safely , " fanning said .
police locked down the neighbourhood before the suspect turned himself in around 6 p.m .
police said kirkpatrick was let go on dec. 11 .
a resident who lives in a nearby apartment building told the canadian press that he did not hear gunshots , but saw a woman run from the party and into a nearby auto repair shop , where it appears she called for help .
" all of a sudden in my front yard there were five totally decked out , geared up riot squad officers with guns out of the holster , aiming at the second floor of the building right beside us , " luke pigeon said .
" i tried to open up my door and they said close your door , lock your door . " .
mark pinder told the canadian press that police ordered a group of film studio employees into the basement of their building , which was across the street from the party .
the group was just about to celebrate the completion of a project when police came knocking , he said .
" people grabbed a couple of bowls of chips and dip and we just sort of moved the party downstairs , " pinder said .
" some people seemed quite concerned but there was n't anyone freaking out or crying .
everyone was calling their family and making sure that people knew they were ok . " .
pigeon said police spent about two hours negotiating with the suspect before bringing him into custody .
" they cuffed him on the ground and they took him into a cruiser , " he said .
" he was giving them a bit of grief , he was saying that his cuffs hurt , but he was following orders . " .
employees who had been at the party at the time of the shooting are receiving counselling from the vancouver police victim 's services team .
" i can not emphasize enough how traumatic this would have been for the people in there to see one of their co-workers gunned down , so we 're going to do all we can to help these people though a very , very difficult time , " fanning said .
