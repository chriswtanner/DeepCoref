no militants were inside a united nations-run school attacked by israeli forces in gaza , leaving 40 people dead , the un says .
christopher gunness from the un relief and works agency said an initial investigation left him 99.9 per cent sure there were no militants at the school .
about 1000 people were sheltering in the school after having been hounded from their homes by warfare , he said .
mr gunness slammed the israeli attack on the school .
" of course it 's appalling , " he told abc television from jerusalem .
" this fighting has to stop . " .
" enough people , among them women and children , have died . " .
mr gunness said civilian deaths were an inevitable consequence of attacking a crowded place like gaza .
" imagine a situation where someone says we 're going to plan a massive air bombardment , but it 'll be pinprick and surgical , on downtown sydney , " he said .
