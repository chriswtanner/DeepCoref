well , here 's something that we all knew would happen eventually .
tara reid has checked into promises treatment center , a prominent rehab clinic in los angeles .
in the late 90s reid was a pop bubblegum princess with a starring role in the american pie franchise and a relationship with carson daly .
now she 's known primarily for partying far too hard and accidentally exposing her naughty bits to the paparazzi .
it 's too late for her to salvage a hollywood career , but at least she can keep her liver from shriveling into a little grey ball .
well , it is n't even released yet , but apparently the positive buzz surrounding the trailers for terminator salvation is enough to warrant making a sequel .
mcg made the announcement in dubai over the weekend , stating that the project was shooting for a 2011 release date .
now , i 'm as excited to see the new terminator movie as anybody , but is this really a good idea ?
what if the film is terrible and bombs at the box office ?
warner brothers appears to be pretty damn confident about this one .
we 'll see what happens .
sadly last week we learned that ricky gervais would not be hosting the oscars .
this was a disappointing blow , but there was hope that chris rock , jon stewart or another favourtie host of recent years would get a chance to return .
sadly that 's not the case .
instead hugh jackman will be hosting what will undoubtedly be the most bland and unfunny oscar night in recent memory .
seriously , jackman ?
why is he qualified to do this ?
they are n't even trying to find good people to host that show anymore .
