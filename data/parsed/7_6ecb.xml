the major heavyweight year ended much as it started , with wladimir klitschko owning the division against overmatched opposition , and with hasim rahman being nothing but a shell of the man that once shockingly knocked out lennox lewis .
klitschko dominated rahman over six-plus rounds , knocking him down in a horribly one-sided sixth round and then landing enough hard blows early in the seventh for referee tony weeks to step in and call an end to it .
that should just about do it for the 36-year old rahman , who has n't scored an impressive or notable win since 2005 .
since that win over monte barrett , rahman has gone 4-2-1 with a no-contest , beating nothing but club fighters , and often not even looking good doing that .
he 's had a long , strange career , and it looks like it 's over at the top tier .
he was so thoroughly overmatched tonight and unwilling to fight klitschko that he 's clearly got nothing left as a top fighter .
klitschko will move on and fight alexander povetkin , chris arreola or david haye sometime in march or april , i 'd wager , and he should be a heavy , heavy favorite against any of them .
arreola was hurt by travis walker , povetkin just does n't strike me as capable of being a truly top-notch guy , and haye was shaken by monte barrett a bit even though he did basically dominate .
i 'd love to see klitschko-haye simply because i think haye will make wlad work .
i said during the fight that this was yet another case of klitschko fighting up or down to his opponent .
haye would make him fight up .
rahman had him fighting down .
the fight as also yet another example of why people crap on heavyweight fighting .
it was n't interesting , was n't competitive , and you clearly had one guy ( rahman ) not in shape to fight for more than five rounds .
and worse than that , he did n't even fight .
in the sixth , he landed one punch .
he spent a lot of time laying on the ropes starting in the third round , barely punching at all .
the hbo team today was lampley , kellerman and lennox , and they did their usual bit when they watch a heavyweight fight with lennox in the booth , which means they made verbal love to lewis while lewis agreed with their assessment of him as better than everyone fighting today .
they 're right , of course -- but we all know that .
there was even one round where lennox decided , out loud , that he is better than wladimir klitschko .
as always , an interesting group that teaches me a lot about the fights i 'm watching .
