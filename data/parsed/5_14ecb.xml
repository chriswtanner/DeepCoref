the philadelphia 76ers fired coach maurice cheeks saturday morning after a disappointing 9-14 start to the 2008-09 season .
the sixers had a three-game losing streak going into saturday night 's contest against washington , and more had been expected from a team that signed free-agent forward elton brand to a five-year , $ 80 million contract in the off-season .
" i made the decision because i felt we were not progressing the way we wanted to progress , " said general manager ed stefanski at a news conference .
" i feel on the floor we were n't executing the philosophy that we want to have as sixers basketball . " .
stefanski said tony dileo , the team 's assistant general manager and senior vice president , will coach the team the rest of this season .
excluding brand 's 15.9 points and 10 rebounds , the team 's stars have not played up to past standards .
andre miller is averaging 15.5 points per game , andre iguodala 14.9 points , a drop of five points per game from last season , while samuel dalembert is down almost five points per game with his 5.8 points and just over two rebounds .
cheeks compiled a 162-139 record in three-plus seasons and coached the 76ers to 40 regular-season victories in 2007-08 before a six-game loss to detroit in the eastern conference quarterfinals .
he is the fifth nba head coach fired this season , joining oklahoma city 's p.j.carlesimo , washington 's eddie jordan , toronto 's sam mitchell and minnesota 's randy wittman .
