war - zone athens : three people dead , many buildings burning as general strike march turns into a battle .
may 5 2010 15 : 14 .
three people have suffocated to death as a result of a fire in marfin bank during ongoing battles between anti - measure protesters and police in athens .
the athens protest march marking the zenith of the general strike called for the 5th of may was attended by an approximate 200 , 000 ( 20 , 000 which is the foreign broadcast number referring to the pame march alone ) , although because of lack of media coverage due to the media participation in the general strike no concrete estimates can be made .
after the pame ( communist party union ) protesters left syntagma square , the first lines of the main march started arriving before the parliament with the first clashes erupting at the end of stadiou street .
the march then walked on the unknown soldier grounds leading the presidential guard to retreat , and attempted to storm the parliament but was pushed back by riot police forces which today demonstrated a particularly staunch attitude and resolve against the demonstrators .
soon battles erupted around the parliament with protesters throwing molotov cocktails and rocks , with one riot police armored van torched , and the police responding by extended use of tear gas that soon made athens' atmosphere unbearably acrid .
as more blocks reached syntagma square , the battles spread across the city center and lasted for more than five hours .
during the clashes several state buildings were set ablaze including the county headquarters of attika .
at the time of writing the ministry of finance is reported to be on fire , and vital tax documents as destroyed by the raging fire .
however the strange thing is that it is the fourth floor of the building that is burning , at a height inapproachable to petrol bombs .
the building is in danger of total collapse .
according to news reports that began at 14 : 00 greek time after , under pressure by the events , most radio and tv stations decided to break their strike , claim that the fire at marfin bank's stadiou street branch that has led to the death of three workers ( one a pregnant woman ) was started by protesters .
however this remains an unsubstantiated claim .
a similar case three decades ago had originally put the blame for the fire at kappa - marousi building on panepistimiou street , leading to the death of several people inside , to anarchists , while its was later proved the fire was caused by tear gas fired by the police .
after the tragic death of the three workers made the round of athens , new clashes started to spread in the greek capital , with a large crowd gathered outside the burned bank when marfin's boss tried to visit the site .
clashes broke out between the crowd and police when the former attacked the bank magnate accusing him of forcing the dead workers to scab on a general strike and locking them in the building despite them demanding to evacuate it since 12 : 00 .
in parliament the communist party of greece has accused the government for the deaths , claiming it was a result of agents provocateur fascist groups .
the claims of the communist party are based on the fact that 50 fascists tried to enter the pame demo bearing the flags of the union earlier in the morning .
the fascists were spotted , chased and sought refuge behind riot police lines .
accusing the extreme - right as being behind the deaths , the coalition of radical left has declared in parliament that the government cannot pretend to be in grief for the loss of life , as it has been attacking human life by all means possible .
meanwhile , extended clashes broke out in salonika where approximately 50 , 000 people marched destroying dozens of banks and corporate shops in greece's second largest city .
clashes with the police continued for several hours .
according to news broadcasts anarchist have occupied the labour center of the city .
in patras , around 20 , 000 protesters were joined by tractor drivers and garbage truck drivers on their vehicles , as flaming barricades were erected along central streets of the city and clashes developed between protestors and the police .
in ioannina the protesters attacked banks and corporate shops leading to extended use of chemicals by the police .
in heraklion , 10 , 000 people are reported as marching against the measures .
in corfu , protesters taking part in the anti - measures march occupied the county headquarters .
protesters have occupied the administrative headquarters of naxos and the city hall of naoussa .
as a result of the athens riots , the police have cordoned off the entire center of the city , erecting check points of entry and exit , while all police work permits have been recalled .
at the time of writing battles continue to rage in the inner city , while news broadcasts claim the police is mobilising its forces to storm an anarchist squat in exarcheia .
