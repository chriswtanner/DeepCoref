a key witness against teenage murder suspect jermayne timmons identified him tuesday as the gunman who killed 10-year-old kathina thomas in may , then twice admitted he lied in his testimony .
elijah coleman , 21 , told jurors in albany county court he and two acquaintances went to west hill on may 29 to " put in some work " and " start trouble . " .
a member of the trio was shot in the foot by rivals on an earlier occasion , he said .
they rode bikes to first and judson streets , he testified , and timmons , now 16 , was armed with a .45 - caliber handgun he had picked up under a trash can at the ida yarbrough apartments in albany .
after a face-off with some rivals who " wanted to fight , " he testified , timmons pulled the trigger .
" jermayne fired the shot , " he said .
kathina , a guyana native in albany less than 16 months , was slain in front of her first street home , near the corner of north lake avenue .
while not disavowing timmons was the shooter , coleman then testified that his third friend , whose shooting they were avenging , actually had shot himself in the foot earlier .
upon cross-examination , coleman then gave a second contradiction , saying he had seen - and never had seen - the .45 - caliber gun timmons allegedly was carrying .
" so which is it ? " deputy public defender peter lynch asked coleman , who in turn said he had seen the gun before .
he admitted he was lying .
when asked about the friend being shot in the foot , he then answered , " i do n't know . " .
at one point , lynch asked coleman , " you just lied to this jury when you told them that , correct ? " .
" yes , " he responded .
during one of the exchanges , assistant district attorney david rossi asked coleman , " are you gon na switch it every time you 're asked the question ? " .
coleman also said that he gave false statements before the case went to trial .
he testified tuesday that he came forward to clear his name in early june , saying he did not shoot the young girl .
meanwhile , coleman testified that he believed the defendant 's name was " jermayne taylor , " yet did identify him in court .
when asked by the prosecution to recall what he was asked before coming to court , he responded he said it was to tell the truth .
rossi laid out the prosecution 's case earlier tuesday in a packed courtroom before judge stephen herrick .
he said timmons and the two acquaintances rode bikes to an area of west hill known as " little miami , " the reason being , " it 's hot - lots of action in that area .
the defendant knew that . " .
rossi said timmons and his two sidekicks were engaged in a staredown with youths at the corner .
he said timmons aimed and missed his target , instead striking the 10-year-old girl less than two seconds later .
" as that little girl lay bleeding to death on the sidewalk , this defendant pedaled off and got rid of the evidence , " rossi said .
the gun has not been recovered .
among prosecutors ' evidence not yet revealed in court is an alleged statement and apology note timmons gave police .
lynch did not deny his client was at first and judson with a loaded handgun when kathina died - or that he fired the weapon .
" as that little girl lay bleeding to death on the sidewalk , this defendant pedaled off and got rid of the evidence , " rossi said .

among prosecutors ' evidence not yet revealed in court is an alleged statement and apology note timmons gave police .
lynch did not deny his client was at first and judson with a loaded handgun when kathina died - or that he fired the weapon .
he said it was a .32 - caliber revolver , not a .45 - caliber handgun like the one that killed the girl .
" because he was there , because he did fire a gun , he 's it , " lynch said .
" he 's the patsy . " .
the prosecution 's first witness was kathina 's mother , shondell mcallister , who fought back emotions to recall the night her child died .
she found herself in a crowd that surrounded kathina outside their home .
mcallister said she had to force her way through the people to speak with authorities as they , too , flooded first street .
" i said , 'i 'm her mother. ... .
that 's my baby , ' " she said .
an official looked at her and said : " i 'm very sorry .
she 's dead . " .
to which she replied, .
" i already know she 's dead . " .
mcallister explained how she and her four children moved to albany from guyana in january 2007 and to first street in september of that year .
she recalled her daughter being on the front steps with , among others , a 1-year-old baby .
after kathina was shot , she exclaimed , " ' mommy , mommy , i got hit .
somebody hit me in my back . " ' .
" i said , 'oh , my god , somebody help me .
my daughter has been shot . " ' .
the mother fought tears later tuesday when images of her daughters post-shooting medical treatment were shown in court .
several members of the victim 's family and that of timmons were in court to watch the proceedings .
timmons faces up to 15 years to life if convicted of second-degree murder .
testimony continues today .
