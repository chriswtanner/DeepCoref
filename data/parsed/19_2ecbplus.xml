riots erupt following death of brooklyn teen killed by police .
in the week following the fatal shooting of 16 - year - old kimani gray , several protests and riots have erupted in the teen's brooklyn neighborhood as the cops involved have come under scrutiny for previous reported civil rights violations .
gray was killed on march 9 by police who claim he pointed a gun at sgt . mourad mourad and officer jovaniel cordova before they opened fire .
an autopsy shows that gray was hit in the back by three of the seven bullets fired by the officers .
a loaded . 38 - caliber revolver was found at the scene .
since the shooting , over 50 arrests have been made over four nights of protesting where community members are expressing outrage and demanding justice .
gray's school principal , matthew willoughby of the urban assembly school of design and construction , wrote a heartfelt letter describing the teen as a hard - working student who was committed to his academics .
"kimani made great strides this year academically , " the letter read .
" he was taking an extra english class after school ; he was writing a dramatic dialogue in another english class ; his group in design class was working on a project to design a school .
now they are working to complete the project without him . " .
"kimani should be remembered for all of who he was--an energetic , kind , playful , independent young man who was trying to learn and grow one day at a time , " willoughby's letter continued .
in the days following gray's death , it's been revealed that both mourad and cordova have reportedly been named in five federal lawsuits with plaintiffs alleging civil rights violations .
as a result , the two men have reportedly cost the city about $215 , 000 in court settlements .
in 2009 and 2010 , mourad was sued three times with allegations including a stop - and - frisk in which mourad and fellow cops pulled down a suspect's underwear , and an illegal arrest in which the plaintiff says he was slammed into a car .
cordova was sued in 2011 and 2012 , with one plaintiff claiming the cop punched him in the eye .
