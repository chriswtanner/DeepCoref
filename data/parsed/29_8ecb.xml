game slips away late as jaguars fall to indy .
late sacks , too much manning give colts comeback win .
the jaguars could n't make the big play and gave up the big play .
that was an all-too-familiar scenario thursday night in a frustrating 31-24 defeat to the indianapolis colts .
the jaguars battled the colts toe-to-toe for almost 55 minutes , but with the score tied 24-24 , they could n't finish off the colts .
first , keiwan ratliff fooled david garrard when he made a coverage move he had n't made all season , intercepted the pass and ran 35 yards for the touchdown .
after the teams traded punts , the jaguars advanced from their 10 to the colts 17 with 48 seconds left when garrard spiked the ball .
again , the jaguars could n't come up with the play to tie the game .
coach jack del rio had already decided to go for two and the victory if the jaguars had scored a touchdown .
on second down , maurice drew ran for 10 yards to the 7 for a first down , but suffered a bruised leg on the play and had to come out .
that caused a 10-second runoff because the jaguars were out of timeouts so they had a first down on the 7 with 17 seconds left .
garrard then threw the ball away over the head of reggie williams in the back of the end zone because he was trying to avoid an interception .
he later said he regretted not giving williams a chance to make the play .
" as i 'm releasing the ball to reggie i 'm pretty much throwing it away because the safeties are high , and then at the last second , he ( safety ) darts down to my underneath guy and i 'm thinking , he 's not even playing reggie .
those are plays you want to say , 'just give him a chance . ' .
i thought it was n't the best coverage [ to throw into ] so go to the next down , " he said .
that left the jaguars with 12 seconds left , still time for two passes in the end zone .
but garrard was sacked on second down and the clock ran out before he could call another play .
" it 's tough .
you do n't want to end the game on a sack when you 're on the seven-yard line .
it 's kind of how the season has been .
so close , so close and then a sack at the end of the game , " garrard said .
that was the difference between the colts ( 11-4 ) clinching a playoff berth with their eighth consecutive victory and the jaguars falling to 5-10 .
that means they 'll have double digit losses for the first time since they went 5-11 in del rio 's first season .
they 're now 24-23 in the regular season the last three years and finished 2-4 in the afc south for the third consecutive season .
garrard completed 28 of 41 passes for 329 yards and a touchdown and a 90.4 passer rating .
but he was n't a match for peyton manning , who completed 29 of 34 for 364 yards and three touchdowns .
of the ratliff interception , garrard said , " you do n't want to put your team in that situation where you let the guy pick it off and run it back for a touchdown .
they made a good play .
it was actually man-coverage and he made a smart play by dropping off dennis [ northcutt ] .
you never see that in man coverage and that was a smart play by him .
they know we like the slant game so on that down and distance , they watched tape .
he just made a good play . " .
ratliff , a former univerasity of florida standout , said he did n't know if garrard saw him , but got good blocking once he made the interception and scored easily .
" i thought we were going to have a shot to win the game , but we came up a little short , " del rio said .
del rio added the jaguars gave up too many " gim me " plays like reggie wayne 's 41-yard touchdown catch when he was wide open down the right sideline in the first half .
" that 's one area we 've come up short all year on , " del rio said .
" we had too many gimmes mixed in there .
that 's kind of plagued us all year . " .
the jaguars scored touchdowns on their first two drives and then tacked on a josh scobee field goal with one second left in the first half for a 17-7 lead at halftime .
dennis northcutt , who caught five passes for 127 yards against the packers last week in his first start of the season , continued to make a big difference in the passing game .
he caught five passes for 68 yards in the first half .
he wound up with eight catches for 101 yards. ratliff said he was surprised the jaguars did n't throw to northcutt more .
the jaguars got an emotional lift when offensive lineman richard collier , whose career ended when he was shot in september , visited the team wednesday night and came out for the coin toss at the start of the game .
linebacker mike peterson , probably playing his final game at municipal stadium , said he had to fight back the tears after seeing collier .
