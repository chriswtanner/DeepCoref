the indian navy said it has captured 23 somali and yemeni pirates who attacked a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden on saturday .
an indian navy ship sent its marine commandos on a helicopter towards the ethiopian flag-bearing vessel mv gibe after getting a distress call from it as it came under fire from two boats , the navy said in a statement .
the boats tried to escape on seeing the navy ship but were chased and the pirates surrendered to the commandos when they boarded the boats .
" twenty-three personnel ( 12 somali and 11 yemeni ) surrendered on boarding , " the navy said .
the pirates , along with their arms and equipment , would be handed over to the appropriate authorities , it said , adding that the ship would return to patrolling the gulf of aden .
last month , the navy said it had sunk a pirate " mother vessel " off somalia in a battle that erupted after the indian ship ins tabar came under attack from gunmen on board the boat .
but the international maritime bureau later said that the vessel destroyed by the indian navy was actually a thai fishing trawler that had been seized by pirates off yemen .
somali pirates have carried out around 100 attacks in the gulf of aden and indian ocean since the start of this year .
they still hold at least 14 foreign vessels and more than 300 crew members to ransom .
