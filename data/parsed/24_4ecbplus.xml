france jewels thefts : robbers ram 4x4 into paris shop .
french police are investigating a daring jewellery robbery in paris - the latest in a series of high - profile thefts in france this summer .
in the early hours of monday , thieves rammed a 4x4 vehicle through the windows of an upmarket jewellery store near the prestigious place vendome .
they made off with 2m euros ( #1 . 7m ; $2 . 6m ) in gems and watches .
in july , a masked jewel thief stole #88m worth of precious stones from the carlton hotel in cannes .
after monday's robbery , the thieves set fire to the 4x4 vehicle in an adjacent side street and made off in a second car .
many of the most famous names in jewellery have their flagship stores in the place vendome , and this is a further embarrassment to the french authorities who have seen a spate of robberies in recent weeks , says the bbc's christian fraser in paris .
inevitably , the finger will again be pointed at the pink panther gang , a loosely aligned network of criminals who are believed to have carried out 300 similar robberies across the world since 1999 , our correspondent says .
the international police agency interpol has recently begun co - ordinating its efforts to track down the gangs' members , many of them from the former yugoslavia .
in 2007 , the gang drove two cars through the window of a jewellery store in dubai , and in less than a minute had escaped with 11m euros of jewellery .
