anger in east flatbush persists over teenager " s killing by the police .
published : march 13 , 2013 .
first came the shooting : an armed teenager killed by police officers on a darkened brooklyn street .
then came the anger : a monday evening vigil marred by an unruly young mob thrashing its way through local businesses ; a second protest the next night ; and another on wednesday night , after which , the police said , someone hit an officer in the face with a brick , another brick was thrown through the window of a police van , and there were 46 arrests -- mostly for disorderly conduct .
two officers suffered minor injuries .
by the time an autopsy of the 16 - year - old was released wednesday , the tension in east flatbush could be measured in the silently flashing lights of squad cars parked at tight intervals along church avenue .
for some , the sight of extra police officers meant a potential reprieve in an area troubled by crime .
for others , it was anything but reassuring .
the police said that two plainclothes officers fatally shot the teenager , kimani gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on saturday after he brandished a revolver and pointed it at them .
the police commissioner , raymond w . kelly , said tuesday that the police had interviewed three witnesses , " two of which say that the officers said , ‘ don " t move . " " .
" another witness said an officer says , ‘ freeze , " " he said .
the officers then fired 11 shots , the police said .
seven bullets hit mr . gray , including three that entered his body from the rear , according to the new york city office of the chief medical examiner .
the autopsy did not establish the order in which the bullets struck mr . gray , or determine the path of the bullets , which might make clearer if mr . gray had his back to the officers when he was shot , or if he had twisted away after being struck from the front .
but the findings , inconclusive though they were , appeared likely to heighten the tensions of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager .
on wednesday night , about 200 people attended the vigil .
the gathering became unruly when about half of them splintered off and marched to a nearby police precinct station house .
after officers in riot gear set up a roadblock on church avenue , mr . gray " s sister mahnefah tried to cross the street and was put into a police car .
she was given a summons and released .
some of the protesters shouted , " that " s the sister , " then started throwing bottles when the police would not release her .
someone hurled a chair .
screams could be heard as skirmishes broke out on side streets .
for local residents , many of whom voiced skepticism about the official account , the situation surrounding mr . gray " s death was grimly familiar .
less than a year before , and only blocks away , a narcotics detective shot and killed an unarmed 23 - year - old woman , shantel davis , as she tried to flee the police in a car that had been reported stolen at gunpoint , the police said at the time .
vigils followed that shooting as well .
but soon the rhythms of daily life returned , marked by what young men and women said was a daily backbeat of police stops .
" you try to put it out of your mind , " said ms . davis " s sister crystal .
in interviews around east flatbush , many spoke of a police department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gangs and informal criminal crews , had sown distrust , especially among young men and women , who feel that their encounters with officers often have racial overtones .
at a barbershop along church avenue , two men on tuesday were discussing the recent shooting when an asian delivery cyclist pulled onto the sidewalk across the street .
" see that guy ? " said elverton thomas , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who was there for a haircut .
" he can ride on the sidewalk .
we can " t . " .
his barber , julian clark , also black , concurred .
two years before , he said , an officer stopped him in front of the shop for sidewalk riding , and then arrested him after the officer said his identification had expired ; he spent a day in custody sorting it out , he said .
" they have a hard time because there " s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , " he said of the police .
" but when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . " .
the seemingly constant presence of the police in the lives of many youths -- both on the street and , increasingly , monitoring conversations on social media -- has left many feeling suffocated , said shanduke mcphatter , 35 , an ex - gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood .
" i understand the state of mind that these youths have , " he said .
" the problem is there is no relationship with the police . " .
at the same time , he said , the situation on the streets has grown more complex for law enforcement : gangs are less organized , replaced instead by informal crews with few requirements and in which leadership is frequently up for grabs among increasingly young members .
" the police say , ‘ look at these kids , they " re wild , " " mr . mcphatter said .
" and then they use that as an excuse to be wild themselves . " .
the rev . terry lee , who runs a local youth ministry and acts as a liaison to the police , said many of the neighborhood shootings involved " kids killing kids " and lamented that the community did not rise up more frequently in anger over those shootings .
but he said he understood why .
" the community we " re living in can get dangerous at times , " he said .
" people are afraid of retaliation . " .
mr . lee said the local 67th precinct had grown more open to the community in recent years .
" the problem is , people still don " t want to go to the police , " he said .
the autopsy report on mr . gray did not specify which of the seven bullets caused the death of the teenager ; that determination awaits further investigation .
one bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs , one in the left thigh and one in the right .
two bullets struck from the front , hitting his right thigh ; one bullet entered his left side , striking his lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm .
john c . cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the police department , said many factors could explain the wounds to the front and back of mr . gray " s body .
" most of the time , it " s the person making a turn , or the position of the officers , " he said , or some combination of the two .
once that person has a gun , he said , the threat to the officers is imminent .
mr . gray " s revolver was loaded with four bullets , the police said .
mr . kelly , the police commissioner , said tuesday that there was " nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines . " .
mr . cerar concurred , saying , " under the reported circumstances , it appears to be a good shooting . " .
but raw feeling in the neighborhood fueled accounts at wide variance with that provided by the police .
some said mr . gray , while armed , did not point the gun ; others said they had heard that there had been no gun at all , or that his hands had been in the air .
a family friend , kevin blacks , 33 , said he was not surprised that the autopsy had found that mr . gray had been shot so many times or hit from behind .
he said he had spoken to mr . gray " s parents .
" the dad is shook , " mr . blacks said , standing by a makeshift memorial for mr . gray .
" he doesn " t sleep .
he doesn " t talk .
he " s still in a dream . " .
local elected officials and clergy members , seeking to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly did not issue new statements wednesday .
" our focus right now is to get the funeral service together , " said gilford t . monrose , a local pastor and community leader who is working with the family on the service ; a date had yet to be set , he said .
on tuesday , police investigators could be seen inside a rite aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampaged through the aisles , turning over displays and assaulting one customer who tried to intervene .
the police released store surveillance video and later announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old , saying he was one of three who hit the customer and took his cellphone .
" nothing justifies that , " mr . kelly said .
he said at a city council hearing on tuesday that the violence had been caused by a disorderly group that broke away from the vigil and did not constitute a riot , as some had termed it .
" that belittles it , " city councilman jumaane d . williams said later , referring to the community anger after the police shooting .
" so now we " re going to wait for something worse , for something that meets the true definition of a riot ? " .
