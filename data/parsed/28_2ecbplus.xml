his body was found by a motel maid july 27 , but harrison county , miss . , coroner gary hargrove said he believed the death occurred july 24 .
mr . larue had a history of heart problems , hargrove said .
considered one of the most mysterious men in the nixon administration , mr . larue served as a presidential aide without title , salary or mention in the white house directory .
yet he was so close to the center of power that he was one of the few present at a march 30 , 1972 , meeting at nixon's vacation home on key biscayne , fla . , at which former attorney general john mitchell discussed the planned break - in and bugging of the democratic national committee headquarters office in the watergate building .
the money for the operation came from nixon's reelection campaign funds , as did "hush money" paid to the watergate burglars and their attorneys , mr . larue later testified to the senate watergate investigative committee .
he was the first administration official to plead guilty to charges in the watergate coverup and was the last to be sentenced .
he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and was sentenced to one to three years , with all but six months suspended .
he served 136 days .
mr . larue came to washington in 1969 as an experienced political hand and was described in a 1972 washington post profile as a squinting , mumbling "faulknerian character , an insignificant - looking man who . . . passionately sought anonymity throughout his wheeler - dealer days . " .
he was considered the liaison between mitchell and mississippi sen . james o . eastland ( d ) , who was chairman of the senate judiciary committee and who supported nixon's judicial appointments .
mr . larue's role during nixon's 1968 election campaign was to woo southern voters .
born in athens , tex . , mr . larue was nicknamed "bubba" in his family and graduated from the university of oklahoma with a bachelor's degree in geology in 1951 .
his father , ike parsons larue , went to jail on crimes involving banking law , and upon his release , struck it rich in the oil and gas business .
the son sold one of their mississippi oil fields for a reported $30 million in 1957 , using his family's newfound wealth to become a political financier .
later that year , mr . larue shot and killed his father in a duck - hunting accident in canada .
mr . larue became active in state republican politics and served on the republican national committee from 1963 to 1968 .
he donated to barry goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign and was an early donor to nixon's 1968 campaign .
he was very close to mitchell , and after the attorney general resigned in 1972 to become campaign director of the committee to re - elect the president ( creep ) , mr . larue went with him .
after the watergate break - in , mr . larue and another aide , robert c . mardian , were put in charge of the coverup , supervising the shredding of documents and destruction of financial records .
hugh w . sloan jr . , former treasurer of the creep finance committee , said under oath that mr . larue and deputy campaign manager jeb stuart magruder told him he might have to commit perjury to protect the watergate conspiracy .
they tried to get him to agree to testify that he gave watergate burglar g . gordon liddy much less than the campaign's financial records showed .
after mr . larue pleaded guilty and served his sentence in 1973 , he returned to mississippi , where he worked in the family oil and real estate development business , his nephew william t . larue said .
the family money had dwindled by the early 1970s , after the larues lost money in the castaways , a las vegas gambling casino they bought in 1963 .
mr . larue said in 1971 , "i'm no millionaire . " .
he was one of many nixon - era figures rumored over the years to be "deep throat , " the undercover source of washington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein .
mr . larue denied that he was deep throat , and woodward said he will not reveal the source's name until after deep throat dies .
survivors include his wife , joyce larue of jackson , miss . ; five children ; and several grandchildren .
