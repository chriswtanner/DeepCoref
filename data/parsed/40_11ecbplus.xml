apple unveils latest macbook pros , ios 6 for iphone and ipad .
june 11 , 2012 at 12 : 36 pm et .
after a witty intro by siri herself , apple ceo tim cook took the stage in san francisco to welcome developers and announce new stuff .
cook had a lot to say about the success of the app program , with 30 billion downloads of 650 , 000 distinct apps worldwide .
once cook rattled off the specs , they played a video about the success of apps , from one that a blind man built to help seeing - impaired people get around , to the successful airbnb , a place for couch surfers to find homes away from home , to a speech therapy tool for ipad that's helping a little girl learn how to communicate .
it may be marketing , but parts are truly touching .
needless to say , the developers applauded profusely .
"we would like to thank everyone in the developer community for the incredible apps that you've done for us , " says cook .
new macbooks .
next , global marketing vp phil schiller announced updates to the macbook line .
the macbook air gets 3rd - gen core chips , up to 2ghz dual - core i7 .
it also gets storage up to 512 gb flash storage , with 2x read speed .
and it gets usb 3 . 0 and a 720p camera .
the new models start shipping today .
the 13 - inch and 15 - inch macbook pros get ivy bridge processors , a new - generation geforce graphics card and usb 3 . 0 , while the prices stay the same .
but the big news is the "next generation" macbook pro , which is about as thin as a macbook air , with a 15 - inch "retina display" of 2880 x 1800 pixels .
it's ridiculously gorgeous and thin .
but it's not just about the display and thinness .
there's a quad - core i7 chip up to 2 . 7ghz ; up to 16gb of ram ; the new geforce kepler graphics and 768gb of internal flash storage .
yow !
battery life sounds right : 7 hours on a charge , with 30 days of standby .
and as for ports : sd , hdmi , usb 3 , a new magsafe 2 and two thunderbolts ports .
there is no optical drive .
read into that what you will , but clearly apple will not be supporting blu - ray anytime soon ( or ever ) .
adobe , autodesk and others are developing apps to work with the new retina display .
( aside to the creative people : hooray for photoshop being in sync with mac development ! ) .
os x 10 . 8 mountain lion .
after the pulse - racing macbook unveiling , apple execs took things down a notch to discuss features of os x 10 . 8 , mountain lion , including drill - down on stuff that has already been revealed .
for a quick look at those features , have a look here .
some awesome ones include messages , dictation , sharing and airplay mirroring , which lets you send up to 1080p video from mac to apple tv .
the new safari is great : you can click a cloud icon to see tabs open on other devices such as ipads and iphones , and if you zoom out , each tab becomes a thumbnail , so you can easily get to the tab you want .
mountain lion will launch next month , and will cost $19 . 99 .
we've got more details on mountain lion's upcoming release here .
ios 6 for iphone and ipad .
following mountain lion , svp of ios software scott forstall took the stage to unveil ios 6 , something that had been somewhat confirmed , but without any details .
first on his agenda was siri : "in eight months , siri has been studying up and learning a lot , " says forstall .
now , in ios 6 , you can ask score of last giants game , even batting average of a given player , team standings .
impressive ( if it works in my house ) .
forstall : "who is taller , lebron or kobe ? " .
siri : "lebron james appears to be slightly taller . " .
in addition to sports , siri does more with restaurant details , and is partnered with yelp for reviews and opentable for reservations .
yes , you can make dinner reservations with siri .
good news for a food person like myself .
for movies , rotten tomatoes reviews are integrated , and you can tap inside siri to watch trailers .
best of all , siri can now launch apps .
new driving mode for siri : "eyes free , " says forstall .
button on steering wheel of some car manufacturers including gm , toyota , honda , land rover , audi , mercedes benz and bmw .
siri will also speak 15 languages including korean , italian , mandarin and cantonese .
facebook integration is next .
integrated within ios 6 ( photos , calendars , contacts , etc . ) and even the app store and itunes , where you can like stuff , instead of pinging it like nobody does now .
forstall says facebook is coming to mac os , too , though it wasn't mentioned earlier .
apple is building its own mapping service , complete with fresh maps of the whole globe , plus built - in turn - by - turn navigation , so you don't need a third - party app anymore .
there's also crowd - sourced traffic data ( anonymously gathered , says apple ) tied into the service , so you have realistic etas and smart routing .
there's also a beautiful new photo mapping feature called "flyover" which lets you view major landmarks in 3 - d .
not sure if they've got your house in there , but it's gorgeous to look upon .
more ios 6 stuff , in rapid succession .
"reply with message" - gives you the option to send canned messages to callers .
also a "remind me later" feature with time and geo - tagged reminders for ignored calls .
"do not disturb" - phone won't bother you with calls and alerts , includes plenty of control ( no calls at all or just calls from favorites , etc ) .
facetime enabled over cellular with ios 6 .
apple is unifying phone numbers and apple ids - - you can now answer calls on ipad or mac - - it's huge news but apt to depress the mobile carriers .
in mobile safari , there's now photo updating , and there's now more cross - talk between apps and browser .
shared photo stream - - think instagramm style comments and integration with mac , iphone , apple tv etc .
vip contacts and a "flagged" mailbox for the most important people in your life .
insert photos and video into mail more easily .
single app mode and guided access let you lock people into one app , for parental control , education , testing , museum tours , etc .
forstall introduced a whole new app , too , called passbook .
codes for boarding passes ( united , amtrak ) , store cards ( starbucks , target ) , tickets ( fandango , sf giants ) , reservations ( w hotels ) , etc . are all collected in one app .
when you visit the store or venue , the app automatically pulls up the right card .
and when you're done with a given card , there's a cute shredding animation .
