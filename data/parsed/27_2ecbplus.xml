microsoft releases out - of - cycle patch for ie flaw .
published on 18th september 2013 .
microsoft's bad september continues to grow worse , with the company being forced to issue an out - of - cycle patch for a zero - day vulnerability in its internet explorer web browser .
microsoft's september got off to a bad start when the company issued a raft of faulty updates as part of its monthly patch tuesday release cycle .
while the issues have now been resolved , the company was forced to remove and re - release a total of ten patches - making it the worst patch tuesday in a six - month run that has seen only a single month go by without a show - stopping fault resulting in patches being reissued following customer complaints .
today's admission from the company isn't going to do much to salve its public image , either : microsoft has confirmed that a flaw in its internet explorer web browser is being actively exploited in targeted attacks , and considers the issue serious enough to release an out - of - cycle fix ahead of next month's patch tuesday .
the update , which is only available for manual installation and will not be published through windows update , is a work - around rather than a true fix for a pretty serious flaw in microsoft's mshtml shim component - which had already been targeted in prior attacks at the start of the year .
'this issue could allow remote code execution if an affected system browses to a website containing malicious content directed towards the specific browser type , ' explained microsoft's dustin childs in an alert to the security community .
'this would typically occur when an attacker compromises the security of trusted websites regularly frequented , or convinces someone to click on a link in an email or instant message .
running modern versions of internet explorer ensures that customers receive the benefit of additional security features that can help prevent successful attacks , ' he added - but while the current targeted attacks are only being pointed at the outdated internet explorer 8 and internet explorer 9 releases , it is thought the flaw could exist across all versions of ie .
for those who use internet explorer , microsoft's advice is to install the out - of - cycle fix - it patch to work around the issue until a proper solution can be found .
the patch applies to all version of internet explorer from ie 6 through to the latest ie 11 , although is only designed to resolve the issue with the 32 - bit version - the 64 - bit version , it would seem , being better protected against the vulnerability .
with microsoft's recent track record for patches causing problems worse than they solve , however , users would be well advised to test the patch on a virtual machine or similar throw - away system before rolling it out on a wider scale .
