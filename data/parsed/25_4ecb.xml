saints place rb bush on injured reserve .
the injury-plagued season of new orleans saints running back reggie bush is over .
the saints placed bush on the injured reserve list wednesday with a sprained left knee , meaning he will miss the team 's final two games against detroit and carolina .
however , given his limited effectiveness last week , the saints decided to shut him down for the remainder of the season .
the former southern california star finished his third season in new orleans with just 404 yards and two touchdowns on 106 carries .
bush suffered a left knee injury against carolina on october 19 and missed the next four games following arthroscopic surgery .
he returned to action against tampa bay on october 30 and scored a touchdown the following week against atlanta .
bush appeared to be on the mend , but he sprained the knee in last thursday 's 27-24 overtime loss at chicago and was limited to only 30 yards on six carries .
on saturday , new orleans coach sean payton indicated that bush would not return to the lineup until further undergoing a further evaluation .
however , given his limited effectiveness last week , the saints decided to shut him down for the remainder of the season .
bush 's absence leaves the saints furthered shorthanded in the backfield as they are now down to pierre thomas and mike bell , who has had only six carries this season after signing with new orleans in week 12 .
to take bush 's roster spot , the saints signed cornerback michael lehan , who had been with the miami dolphins .
