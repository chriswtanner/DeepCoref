turkmenistan voted sunday in a parliamentary election meant to show that the energy-rich central asian nation was shedding its autocratic past , but western observers said nothing had changed .
authorities said turnout reached 93.87 percent in the election for 288 candidates , all of whom support the policies of president gurbanguly berdymukhamedov in the ex-soviet republic .
voting stations were festooned with turkmen flags and pictures of berdymukhamedov , the successor of eccentric dictator saparmurat niyazov , who ruled turkmenistan for two decades until his death in 2006 .
over 2.5 million people were eligible to vote in the election , held under the framework of a new constitution approved in september and intended to increase parliament 's powers and raise the number of seats from 65 to 125 .
" i attach hopes for the better to these elections , especially for our children , " valentina redzhepova , an official at one of ashgabat 's voting precincts , told afp .
" we are waiting for borders to open even further so more guests can come to us and so we can visit them . " .
voters , however , appeared reluctant to criticise the government .
in gyami , a village outside the turkmen capital , 25-year-old guzel said she had come to the local polling station to vote and watch her daughter perform in a children 's folk-dance troupe .
" i voted for our fellow village resident .
he is an experienced person and knows village life well , " she said .
pensioner bayram-aga , a voter in ashgabat , said .
" i remember the elections from the soviet days. ... .
people were very active then , it was like a festival .
now it 's much quieter . " .
western observers say niyazov still casts a shadow , despite promises of openness by berdymukhamedov and some moves to dismantle the late dictator 's bizarre personality cult .
niyazov 's gold statue still towers over the desert nation 's capital , rotating to face the sun .
" the facade has changed but the foundations remain the same , " said a western diplomat , who requested anonymity .
" power rests entirely with the president .
his photo appears every day on the front of the papers .
he strictly controls the economy and the whole of the media , " the diplomat added .
new york-based human rights watch said in an assessment last month that turkmenistan had made " some progress " but " remains ... one of the most repressive and authoritarian states in the world . " .
the elections are unlikely to get a clean bill of health from the west , not least as all candidates have stressed support for the president while campaigning .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe sent eight experts to monitor the poll and draw up an " internal report . " .
the group 's spokesman , jens hagen eschenbecher , told afp that the experts would not be making any public statements on their conclusions .
ninety percent of the 288 candidates come from the democratic party set up by niyazov in place of the communist party , with the other 10 percent coming from so-called " initiative groups " that have little clout .
all candidates are funded by the state , with a ban on other funding .
western journalists have been refused permission to cover the vote .
foreign election observers will mainly come from the commonwealth of independent states , a post-soviet group with little credibility .
with its enormous natural gas reserves , turkmenistan is central to european efforts to diversify gas supplies away from russia .
berdymukhamedov has voiced support for giving the west more access to turkmen gas .
