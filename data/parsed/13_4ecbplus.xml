arson in alaska--a palin " pattern " ?
november 20 , 2012 .
there is an old saying that " once is chance ; twice is coincidence ; the third time is a pattern .
it was probably " chance " when the wasilla bible church was burned , and arson was suspected .
it was determined that an acelerant was placed around the perimeter of the church .
no arrests were made in that fire .
the interesting part of that blaze reported that it didn " t harm the larger areas of the church where worship services were held .
instead it was , according to sarah palin , the offices where church records were stored , that was destroyed .
if there were church records that would reveal something sarah palin didn " t want uncovered , the destruction of those records by fire would solve that problem .
when arson was suspected in the burning of the house of dar miller it was probably just coincidence .
it was probably just coincidence that sarah palin is not supportive of people who are homosexual , and it appears dar was lesbian , and lived with her " partner . " .
of course it was not coincidence that dar miller was in her home when the fire broke out and was burned so badly she died the next day .
it was not coincidence that her dogs died in the fire as they lived with her .
it was unusual that the dogs died at the foot of her bed , instead of by the door , trying to get out of the house .
it was probably just coincidence that dar miller had previously worked at the mat - su regional hospital as a neo - natal nurse , which is the same hospital where trig was purportedly born .
the curious thing is that there was never an arrest made in that fire either .
the suggesting was that dar miller had probably been smoking in bed and caught herself and the bed on fire .
who made that suggestion ?
did they know that dar didn " t smoke ?
( according to ottoline commenting in this blog ) .
the fire that burned so hot that it " charred beams and melted pictures on the wall " doesn " t sound like a fire caused by a cigarette in bed .
the troubling " pattern " emerges as there is report of yet another fire in the small community of palmer alaska .
this time the fire occurred at the matanuska maid creamery .
you remember .
that dairy was the subject of a thorough investigation by andrew halcro .
andrew " s suggestion was that sarah palin had fraudulently diverted large sums of money to friends and high school buddies .
within a week of the dissolution of the last entity to run the matanuska maid creamery , its building burned to the ground .
arson is likely , given the fact that the building was without electrical or gas connections and the fire broke out at 3 : 30 am .
all three fires appear to be the result of arson .
all three fires occurred in or around the small town of alaska where sarah palin lives .
all three fires may have conferred some benefit on sarah palin .
when the church fire destroyed church records , i suspected foul play , but knew that it was probably just chance .
when dar miller " s home was burned and she was killed by the blaze , i suspected foul play , but knew that it could be merely coincidence .
now that the dairy has burned , and foul play seems clear , there is an unmistakable pattern .
given the fact that none of these crimes has been " solved , " a pattern is emerging .
i wonder how long it will be before the anchorage police department will issue a press release stating that there is not one scintilla of evidence connecting any of the members of the palin family with these cases of arson ?
