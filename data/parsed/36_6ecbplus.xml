warren jeffs convicted of child sexual assault charges .
published thursday , august 4 , 2011 5 : 55pm edt .
a texas jury convicted polygamist sect leader warren jeffs of child sexual assault thursday in a case stemming from two young followers he took as brides in what his church calls "spiritual marriages . " .
the 55 - year - old head of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints stood stone - faced as the verdict was read .
jeffs , who acted as his own attorney , faces up to life in prison .
the jury went immediately into sentencing proceedings .
they had deliberated on a verdict for more than three hours .
police had raided the group's remote west texas ranch in april 2008 , finding women dressed in frontier - style dresses and hairdos from the 19th century as well as seeing underage girls who were clearly pregnant .
the call to an abuse hotline that spurred the raid turned out to be a hoax , and more than 400 children who had been placed in protective custody were eventually returned to their families .
but authorities brought charges against several men from the group , with jeffs by far the highest - profile defendant .
prosecutors used dna evidence to show jeffs fathered a child with a 15 - year - old girl and played an audio recording of what they said was him sexually assaulting a 12 - year - old girl .
they also played audio recordings in which jeffs was heard instructing young women on how to please him sexually .
jeffs has claimed he was the victim of religious persecution .
the flds , which has at least 10 , 000 members nationwide , is a radical offshoot of mainstream mormonism .
the church believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven and that jeffs is god's spokesman on earth .
jeffs stood mute and expressionless , staring at the floor , for all but a few seconds of the half hour he was allotted for a closing argument on thursday .
at one point he mumbled , "i am peace , " and said no more .
the only noise in the courtroom was the creaking of wooden benches brimming with spectators .
prosecutors said the case had nothing to do with his church or his beliefs .
"you have heard the defendant make repeated arguments about religious freedoms , " said lead prosecutor eric nichols .
"make no mistake , this case is not about any people , this case is not about any religion .
it is about one individual , warren steed jeffs , and his actions . " .
prosecutors relied heavily on information found during the raid on the compound and after a traffic stop in nevada in 2006 , when jeffs was arrested .
much of the material was discovered in a vault at the end of a secret passageway in the temple and another vault in an annex building .
"you might have asked yourselves , " nichols said , "a lot of people may ask , why would someone record sex ? . . .
this individual considers himself to be the prophet .
everything he did , hour after hour , he was required to keep a record of that . " .
on one of the tapes played at the trial , jeffs made a reference to "drawing close" or "being close , " which authorities testified is how church members refer to sex .
two female voices said "ok . " .
"a good wife is trained for her husband and follows the spirit of peace , " jeffs was heard saying .
another audio tape included jeffs and the younger girl from a recording made in august 2006 at the texas compound , according to testimony from nick hanna , a texas ranger involved in the 2008 raid .
played in court , it was difficult to decipher , but jeffs' and a female voice are heard .
he says , "i perform this service in the name of jesus christ , amen , " then mentions the alleged victim by name .
when she says something , he responds , "don't talk while praying . " .
several minutes of heavy breathing followed .
the jury wore headphones to better hear the recording and also followed a transcript .
one female juror covered her face with her hand as she listened .
jeffs represented himself after firing seven attorneys in the six months leading to the trial .
he broke his courtroom silence with an objection marked by a nearly hourlong speech defending polygamy , and twice threatened the judge and the court with warnings of punishment from god .
he refused to cross - examine the state's witnesses , and delayed giving an opening statement until he began presenting his own defence .
in that statement , he evoked images of the civil rights movement and mentioned former mormon leader joseph smith jr .
he also asked the jury to remember constitutional guarantees of religious freedom .
the lone defence witness jeffs called , church elder jd roundy , spent about 10 minutes on the stand thursday discussing flds history after 4 1 / 2 hours of testimony wednesday evening .
jeffs failed three times to remove state district judge barbara walther from the case , the last rejection coming even without a hearing .
he claimed walther was biased because she issued the warrant for the original raid and was frequently updated as it progressed .
eleven other flds men were charged with crimes including sexual assault and bigamy .
all seven of those who have been prosecuted were convicted , receiving prison sentences of between six and 75 years .
