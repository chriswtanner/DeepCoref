published : july 29 , 2004 .
frederick c . larue , a top nixon campaign official who passed money from a secret white house fund to buy the silence of the watergate burglars , died saturday at a hotel in biloxi , miss .
he was 75 .
his heart failed while he was reading a book , his son , ike larue iii , said .
he lived in biloxi and jackson , miss .
fred larue's career was intertwined with that of richard m . nixon from the time he transferred his considerable financial support to nixon from the defeated presidential candidate barry goldwater in 1964 .
he was an architect of nixon's successful strategy for capturing southern votes and then a significant participant in the watergate scandal .
mr . larue pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in july 1973 .
he served a reduced sentence of four and a half months in federal prison in return for cooperating with prosecutors investigating the break - in at the watergate complex , which housed the headquarters of the democratic national committee , on june 17 , 1972 .
he was at the meeting in key biscayne , fla . , on march 30 , 1972 , where john n . mitchell , the former attorney general who became head of nixon's re - election campaign committee , and jeb stuart magruder , mr . mitchell's deputy , approved a "dirty tricks" campaign , including the watergate break - in .
mr . larue was also at the meeting after the break - in at which some of the same officials scurried to come up with money for the burglars .
mr . larue personally delivered payments .
nixon acknowledged his own involvement in the cover - up , but always denied advance knowledge of the break - in .
in a heated exchange with mr . magruder in 2003 , mr . larue supported nixon's claim of ignorance of the initial burglary .
mr . larue's main argument was that he had been in charge of the phone at a florida meeting of the top campaign staff where the break - in was planned and was monitoring all calls .
nixon never called , he said in an interview with the sun herald , a biloxi newspaper .
also , he said his personal relationship with mitchell was so close that mitchell would certainly have told him .
mr . larue denied suggestions that he was "deep throat , " the secret watergate source used by bob woodward in his joint coverage of the scandal with carl bernstein for the washington post .
mr . larue said he believed the secret informer was an amalgam of several people , but mr . woodward has said that it is one person and that he will reveal that person's identity after his death .
mr . larue , whose family amassed a fortune in the oil business , played an important role with nixon many years before watergate .
after contributing heavily to goldwater's losing presidential campaign in 1964 , he became a leading supporter of nixon .
in particular , he helped develop a "southern strategy" for the republicans to recapture southern states from the democrats .
after nixon's election in 1968 , mr . larue worked in the white house without title or salary .
partly through his friendship with senator james o . eastland , the mississippi democrat who was chairman of the judiciary committee , mr . larue helped to win confirmation for nixon's nominees to the federal bench .
"he was an elusive , anonymous , secret operator at the highest levels of the shattered nixon power structure , " the new york times reported in 1973 .
"he is a man of personal mystery , too - a latter - day character , it sometimes seemed , out of a southern gothic novel . " .
frederick cheney larue was born oct . 11 , 1928 , in athens , tex .
his father , ike parsons larue sr . , whom fred larue shot and killed in a canadian duck - hunting accident in 1957 , was a first cousin of sid richardson , the texas oil and ranching tycoon .
the elder mr . larue had gone to jail for banking violations and moved to mississippi to look for oil .
his company discovered the giant bolton field , which fred's generation sold for $30 million in 1967 .
fred larue spread money to local and national politicians , and , despite his shyness , acquired the nickname bubba .
he became a republican national committeeman .
in the end , mr . larue was one of the first top nixon aides to cooperate with prosecutors .
"larue had stressed that it was time for both of us to think about protecting ourselves and our families instead of continuing to worry about protecting mitchell and the president , " mr . magruder wrote in his 1974 book , "an american life : one man's road to watergate . " .
mr . larue is survived by his wife , joyce burleson larue ; his sons ike iii , of jackson , and fred jr . , of brandon , miss . ; his daughters patricia larue of arlington , tex . , leslie larue of manhattan , grace burleson larue of crystal springs , miss . ; his brother , ike jr . ; his sister , ruthie larue owen of jackson ; and nine grandchildren .
in the interview with the sun herald , mr . larue guessed that the healthy regimen of his months in prison added 10 years to his life .
"the warden let me make a badminton court out of the volleyball court , " he said .
"we had some of the best badminton players in the country . " .
