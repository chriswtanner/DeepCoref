last may , a stray bullet killed 10-year-old kathina thomas as she played on the front steps of her home on albany 's first street .
her death sparked outrage , and even prompted the community to come together to get guns off albany streets .
now the case is back in the spotlight as the 16-year-old accused of firing the fatal shot , jermayne timmons , goes to trial .
more than 100 potential jurors walked into the albany county courthouse monday .
inside , men and women from all walks of life were slowly eliminated , answering questions such as " had you heard , seen or read anything about the death of thomas ? " .
such a query would be difficult thing to say " no " to , given all the media attention that the 10-year-old 's death and timmons ' subsequent arrest brought .
by 5:00pm monday , selection was winding down for the day as five were already picked for the jury .
timmons remained at the courthouse along with defense attorney peter lynch and albany county district attorney dave rossi .
" the evidence in this case is gon na ' show factually that jermayne is not the person who caused [ thomas ' ] death , " lynch told local media monday .
however , lynch has a tough job ahead of him in proving that his client did not pull the trigger and , in the end , kill thomas .
this , when police have released an alleged confession from timmons , and a letter of apology that he is said to have written to the girl 's mother that reads , " i am so sorry that the gun i shot is the gun that could have takeing ( sic . ) your baby girl away from you , " .
king provided an explanation , saying , " the so-called apology note was posed more in the question of if [ timmons ] , in some way , could have been responsible , he would have been apologetic for it , " .
none of thomas ' family members were present in the courthouse monday , only timmons ' friends and relatives .
also absent were those who are expected to be called on as witnesses .
in an unprecedented move , albany county assistant district attorney dave rossi asked the media to keep the identities of certain witnesses quiet .
" if we start seeing names in the paper or on the news on day one , i think it 's gon na ' make it more difficult for us to have witnesses in the seat on day two , three and four , " he said .
one of the witnesses that can be talked about is jermayne timmons ' own mother , who is expected to take the stand .
jury selection will likely go on until sometime tuesday .
it was more than seven months ago when that errant bullet killed kathina thomas .
the 10-year-old was shot on the night of may 29th while she was playing outside her first street home .
less than two weeks later , jermayne timmons was arrested and charged with the shooting .
it was discovered shortly after the arrest that timmons had written an apology letter to the mother of kathina thomas , saying the bullet was not meant to hit the girl .
in response to the fallout over thomas ' death , and further gun violence in albany , district attorney david soares announced a gun buyback program in mid-june , offering up gift cards to anyone who brought in a gun .
