many people were shocked and saddened to learn that beloved pin-up icon bettie page passed away yesterday in los angeles after lingering in a coma for a week following a heart attack .
she was 85 .
personally , i was n't surprised because i thought she died several years ago .
page is best known by her fans for her risque bondage films and pictures , and her infamous sense of style , which continues to influence everyone from mortician goth girls to rockabilly cholas in my high school to dita von teese , who 's complete act is utterly ripped off from her .
to me , she 'll always be the kooky , naive christian portrayed by gretchen mol in the notorious bettie page .
but more than that , she was trailblazer for sexy unconventional women everywhere .
without her , the suicide girls would n't exist , although it 's questionable whether that 's a real loss .
i chose the above picture to memorialize her because everyone loves monkeys .
rip bettie !
i 'll drink a martini and listen to a cramps song in your memory tonight .
