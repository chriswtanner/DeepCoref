advanced micro devices on wednesday announced a deal to acquire startup seamicro , a maker of microservers and data center fabric technology , for $334 million .
seamicro chief executive andrew feldman will become general manager of a newly formed amd business unit called data center server solutions .
"seamicro's leading - edge fabric technology together with amd opteron processors point the way to a compelling roadmap for the cloud data center market , " said lisa su , senior vice president and general manager of amd's global business units , in a discussion with reporters at the chip maker's sunnyvale , calif . headquarters ahead of the announcement .
the company will continue to honor seamicro's existing relationships with its own partners , su said , and will sell seamicro - branded servers , which currently use server chips made by amd archrival intel .
feldman , who also spoke with media wednesday , said seamicro's technology was "processor - agnostic , " so incorporating amd's opteron processors and even non - x86 instruction sets and architectures in future products would be easy to do .
amd representatives said they believed seamicro's unique supercompute fabric was a major innovation in data center technology , characterizing the platform as a "new server building block" which would increasingly make its way into the growing cloud infrastructure space .
"when you're talking about the ability to tie together large amounts of processor cores , hundreds and even thousands , within a server system , there aren't a lot of choices out there [ in terms of competitors ] , particularly if you want to bring ethernet over it and disk traffic over it , there's just us , " said feldman , describing his company's technology .
"nobody else can move both ethernet and disk traffic , because they have very different requirements , " he added .
feldman said seamicro's suitors were numerous in the days leading up to the amd acquisition and included more than just semiconductor companies .
in recent months , intel and other companies had spoken highly of the innovative startup .
"we were fortunate that when we began speaking with amd , they had far and away the most sophisticated view on fabrics , " he said .
"they had already done extensive work on what a next - generation fabric could look like .
they were kindred spirits and when you find that , you can move very quickly .
and they really moved with dazzling speed . " .
amd president and chief executive rory read also addressed the deal in a statement , saying that the seamicro acquisition would accelerate "amd's transformation into an agile , disruptive innovator capable of staking a data center leadership position . " .
