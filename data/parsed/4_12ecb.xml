yesterday in los angeles , pin-up icon bettie page succumbed to complications from a heart attack suffered almost three weeks ago .
few women in modern history have incited such lust and reverence in men and women alike .
to the rockabilly culture , she embodied the ideal woman - voluptuous and healthy , with that leveling sneer .
she seemed to dare you to not stare at her .
her hairstyle launched a thousand girls to slice off their bangs and get out the black dye .
literally tens of thousands of women are walking around today as perfect bettie clones of all shapes and sizes .
with her nude photoshoots , the bondage angle and her defiance in the face of censorship , she was a precursor to the '70s feminist movement - '50s punk rock in heels and garters .
page has been the inspiration for dozens of songs all across the musical landscape , but it was the rockabilly guys that took to her the most ; not to mention female-fronted bands like the horrorpops or even pop 's katy perry .
even amy winehouse 's look in the beginning was a derivative of page .
