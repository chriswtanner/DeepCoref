damaged cables cause internet outages for millions .
up to 70 % of communications to the middle east have been disrupted after cables connecting region to europe were damaged .
millions of web users across the middle east are struggling to get online after damage to undersea cables connecting europe , africa and asia took down a major route for internet traffic .
as much as 70 % of internet traffic and telephone communications between the continents has been affected by the outage .
it is believed to have been caused by damage to a string of cables which run on the bed of the mediterranean sea between italy and egypt , connecting europe with other parts of the world .
the lines , which run hit the egyptian coast at alexandria and go on to connect to asia , are responsible for carrying vast amounts of internet traffic and phone calls between different parts of the world .
it remains unclear what precisely what caused the damage , but the egyptian communications ministry said that ships have already been dispatched to look at the problem - although repairs will take " several days " .
jonathan wright , a director at telecoms company interoute , said that the outage could have a devastating affect on business and communication around the world .
" the potential impact of an outage of this size can not be underestimated - it is like severing a major artery , " he said .
" global internet connectivity is reliant on sub-sea cables connecting countries . " .
the incident comes less than a year after a similar outage brought a halt to communications between europe , africa and asia .
those problems were believed to have been caused by ships ' anchors ripping through another section of the same cables , but were exacerbated by simultaneous damage in lines through the middle east .
as many as 75 million people were affected in countries as far apart as india , egypt and dubai .
it is not yet clear whether today 's outage is the same order of magnitude .
despite the prevalence of wireless internet and satellite connections , global communications are still largely reliant on the vast webs of fibre optic cables which cover the planet .
the lines , which take years of planning to install , move traffic backwards and forwards across continents .
the cables hit by the latest incident are among the most vital information pipelines linking europe to the rest of the world - and are responsible for the majority of all connectivity in the middle east and south asia .
according to alan mauldin , research director of communications analysis company telegeography , the succession of problems in the region are only likely to be remedied by a series of new cables which are currently being planned .
" many new cable systems are slated to enter service between europe and egypt in the next few years , " he said .
