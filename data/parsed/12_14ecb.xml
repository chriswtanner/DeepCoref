the indian navy has captured 23 pirates who threatened a merchant vessel in the lawless waters of the gulf of aden .
the indians say the pirates were from somalia and yemen , two countries on the coast of the gulf .
also , a german naval helicopter thwarted another attack today on a freighter being chased by speedboats off yemen .
both ships that were targeted by the pirates are said to be ethiopian .
somali pirates recently seized a saudi supertanker loaded with $ 100 million of crude oil .
also , the threat of pirates recently prompted a german cruise ship to evacuate some 420 passengers and crew after the company decided not to risk their safety as the ship passed through the gulf of aden .
secretary of state condoleezza rice is set to ask the u.n. to authorize " all necessary measures " against the increasingly bold somalian pirates .
