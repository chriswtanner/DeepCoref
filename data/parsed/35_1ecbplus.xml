chargers defensive tackle jamal williams was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving , the team's second such arrest in less than a month .
williams was pulled over for speeding early sunday on a freeway outside downtown , the california highway patrol said .
williams gave a blood sample for a blood - alcohol test , but the results won't be known for a few weeks .
williams was booked into county jail and later released on bail .
the city attorney's office said the case hadn't been submitted as of tuesday .
"it's disappointing to hear about the issue involving jamal williams , " general manager a . j . smith said in a statement released by the team .
"we'll continue to monitor the situation and let the legal process run its course .
"the chargers have always been leaders and positive contributors to our community , " smith added .
"we take our stature in the community very seriously .
through the chargers and the nfl , our players receive one of the most comprehensive education and support programs in sports to help them deal with issues that affect all segments of society . " .
smith didn't return a call seeking further comment .
chargers receiver vincent jackson was arrested for investigation of dui on jan . 6 , five days before san diego's playoff loss at pittsburgh .
jackson is due in court feb . 17 .
he was on probation for a previous dui arrest , the chp said .
williams , an 11 - year veteran , shared the team's most valuable player award with quarterback philip rivers this season .
the chargers reached the playoffs with an 8 - 8 record .
coincidentally , the chargers were the first nfl team to implement safe ride solutions , a program in which pro athletes who've had too much to drink can call a toll - free number and request a ride from an off - duty police officer .
for implementing the program , the chargers were awarded the nfl's winston - shell award for demonstrating commitment and dedication to developing unique and innovative ideas and solutions .
smith often speaks of signing "character" players , yet the chargers have had their share of off - field problems in recent seasons .
in 2006 , there were seven run - ins with the law by chargers players , including linebacker steve foley's shooting by an off - duty coronado police officer who suspected him of drunken driving , and two other players who were arrested for investigation of dui .
besides the arrests , linebacker shawne merriman was suspended four games for testing positive for steroids in 2006 , and linebacker stephen cooper was suspended by the nfl for the first four games of the 2008 season after testing positive for a banned stimulant .
