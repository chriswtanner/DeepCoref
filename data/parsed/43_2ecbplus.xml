amd to acquire seamicro : accelerates disruptive server strategy .
seamicro low - power , high - bandwidth microserver solutions set the stage for amd " s disruptive approach to lead fast - growing cloud data center market .
sunnyvale , calif . --2 / 29 / 2012 .
amd ( nyse : amd ) today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire seamicro , a pioneer in energy - efficient , high - bandwidth microservers , for approximately $334 million , of which approximately $281 million will be paid in cash .
through the acquisition of seamicro , amd will be accelerating its strategy to deliver disruptive server technology to its oem customers serving cloud - centric data centers .
with seamicro " s fabric technology and system - level design capabilities , amd will be uniquely positioned to offer industry - leading server building blocks tuned for the fastest - growing workloads such as dynamic web content , social networking , search and video .
amd " s server technology combined with seamicro technology provides customers with a range of processor choices and platforms that can help significantly reduce data center complexity , cost and energy consumption while improving performance .
amd plans to offer the first amd opteronâ„¢ processor - based solutions that combine amd and seamicro technology in the second half of 2012 .
the company remains firmly committed to its traditional server business , and will continue to focus and invest in this area .
" by acquiring seamicro , we are accelerating amd " s transformation into an agile , disruptive innovator capable of staking a data center leadership position , " said rory read , president and ceo , amd .
" seamicro is a pioneer in low - power server technology .
the unmatched combination of amd " s processing capabilities , seamicro " s system and fabric technology , and our ambidextrous technology approach uniquely positions amd with a compelling , differentiated position to attack the fastest growing segment of the server market . " .
seamicro technologies offer substantial advantages in large data center and cloud environments .
cloud data centers are projected to be the fastest growing segment of the server market through 2015 , according to idc1 .
current systems featuring seamicro technology typically use one quarter the power and take one sixth the space of traditional servers with the same compute performance , yet deliver up to 12 times the bandwidth per core2 .
foremost among seamicro " s innovations is their supercompute fabric , which connects thousands of processor cores , memory , storage and input / output traffic .
seamicro " s fabric supports multiple processor instruction sets .
seamicro solutions are currently deployed in multiple sites across the world .
amd will continue to support all current seamicro customers while accelerating plans to deliver new platforms that combine amd and seamicro technology and enable amd " s oem partners to bring differentiated solutions to market .
" cloud computing has brought a sea change to the data center - - dramatically altering the economics of compute by changing the workload and optimal characteristics of a server , " said andrew feldman , seamicro ceo , who will become general manager of amd " s newly created data center server solutions business .
" seamicro was founded to dramatically reduce the power consumed by servers , while increasing compute density and bandwidth .
by becoming a part of amd , we will have access to new markets , resources , technology , and scale that will provide us with the opportunity to work tightly with our oem partners as we fundamentally change the server market . " .
the acquisition does not change amd " s 2012 financial guidance and the transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings after 2012 .
