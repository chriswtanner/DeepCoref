india suffers massive internet disruption after undersea cables break .
millions of people across the middle east and asia have lost access to the internet after two undersea cables in the mediterranean suffered severe damage .
huge numbers in egypt and india were left struggling to get online as a result of the outage , when the major internet pipeline between egypt and italy was cut .
internet service providers ( isps ) throughout the region , including those in united arab emirates , kuwait and saudi arabia , also reported problems .
international telephone calls , which have also been affected , are being rerouted to work around the problem .
industry experts told the times that two sub-sea cables went down just off alexandra , causing the mass disruption .
" it is incredibly rare to experience a dual-break where both cables are down simultaneously , " said a spokesperson for interoute , the internet networks company .
the egyptian ministry said it will take " several days " for cables to be repaired and is trying to reroute egypt 's internet connections .
indian isps said their problems were due to the cable damage off egypt .
speaking to reporters , rajesh chharia , president of the internet service providers ' association of india , said : " information technology companies , software companies and call centres that provide online services to the uk or the us east coast are the worst affected . " .
rafaat hindy , from the egyptian ministry , said : " despite this being an international cable affecting many gulf and arab countries , we are closest to it and so we have a lot of responsibility .
" we are working as fast as we can . " .
it is thought that up to 70 per cent of web services in egypt , and 60 per cent in india , were disrupted yesterday .
there were reports that phone and internet difficults had spread to yemen , sudan , bangladesh and sri lanka .
the shut down will take several days to fix , and could have a major impact on the region and across the world .
it is likely to hit businesses who will struggle to communicate in the affected countires .
call-centres who work for british companies are likely to be offline or hard to contact in the coming days .
others warned that bank and stock market trading could be affected .
the digital blackout highlighted the vulnerability of global communications .
hundreds of millions of people access the web , but the vast majority of international traffic runs through a a small amount of cables submerged below the sea .
industry insiders warned that a domino effect was occuring today , causing the disruption to spread across the globe .
as companies ' private internet services went down , workers were forced to use the public internet and mobile phones to communicate .
this has resulted in a heavy strain on phone and internet networks , meaning calls could go down and cause the internet to become slower or blackout completely .
