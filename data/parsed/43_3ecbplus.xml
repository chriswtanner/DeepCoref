amd enters server business with bold acquisition .
02 . 29 . 12 4 : 15 pm .
chip designer and chief intel rival amd has signed an agreement to acquire seamicro , a silicon valley startup that seeks to save power and space by building servers from hundreds of low - power processors .
with the purchase , amd will not only turn itself into a server maker , it will turn itself into a server maker that uses chips from intel .
today , seamicro " s servers are built with processors from amd " s rival , including intel " s atom mobile processors as well as intel xeon chips .
amd says it will continue to sell and support seamicro servers equipped with intel chips " for the foreseeable future . " .
but it also hopes to license seamicro " s server " fabric " technology to other server sellers , including big names dell and hp , and it plans to introduce amd opteron chips into seamicro machines sometime in the second half of the year .
seamicro " s fabric is a way of efficiently connecting various pieces of server hardware , and the company says it can be used with virtually any processor .
less than a month ago , intel and seamicro held a joint press event where they predicted a bright future together , so it would appear that the amd acquisition came about rather quickly .
but amd " s lisa su -- the company " s senior vice president and general manager for its global business units -- says the chip designer has been eyeing technologies along the lines of seamicro " s for some time .
" we " ve been looking at the key technology innovations that are going to really disrupt the server market .
we " ve been looking at fabric technologies -- externally with a number of companies as well as internally , looking to develop ourselves -- and we felt that seamicro was really the best option .
it was proven , and it was in systems , " su said on wednesday morning during a briefing with reporters .
" the complement of our processing capability and seamicro " s fabric technology gives us what we think is a very , very strong [ intellectual property ] portfolio . " .
amd will pay $334 million for seamicro , including $281 million in cash .
the deal is expected to close in " a number of weeks . " .
based in sunnyvale , california , seamicro is at the forefront of a movement to build servers from ultra - low - powered processors -- aka " wimpy cores . " .
the idea is to reduce power by splitting applications into small pieces that can be spread across a larger number of chips , not unlike the one running your cell phone .
texas startup calxeda offers " wimpy core " servers equipped with chips using the arm instruction set -- an alternative to the x86 instruction set used by intel and amd -- while hp is exploring the idea with a research effort it calls project moonshot .
but last month , during that press event co - hosted by intel , seamicro announced that it would also offer servers equipped with intel xeon chips , which were specifically designed for servers .
xeon consume more power , but they also offer more speed .
seamicro says that certain software workloads are suited to the wimpy cores , while others are suited to " brawny cores , " and this same message is delivered by the likes of dave andersen , the carnegie melon professor who coined the wimpy core name .
whatever processor it uses , seamicro says , it can save power and space when you compare its machines to traditional servers .
the company has built specialized asic chip loaded with software that allows the company to build ultra - small motherboards that include little more than processors , memory , and the asic itself -- and then connect hundreds of these boards .
according to the company , this technology is " chip agnostic , " meaning it can relatively easily be used with new chip architectures .
amd and seamicro say that they will " explore " the use of seamicro " s fabrics with all sorts of processors , both wimpy and brawny .
this may include arm chips .
in recent weeks , amd has hinted that it will eventually license arm technology .
asked if the company will continue to offer ultra - low - power chips along the lines of the intel atom , seamicro ceo and co - founder andrew feldman said " absolutely . " .
but he declined to point to specific processor architectures .
" this [ seamicro fabric ] technology can work with larger cores and small cores .
it can work with x86 and non - x86 .
it can also move ethernet traffic and storage traffic , " feldman said .
amd chief technology officer mark papermaster then piped up to point out that amd is intent on using whatever chip technologies are needed to get a particular job done .
" if you look at our roadmap , we have a very agile [ system - on - a - chip ] , " he said .
" it allows us to be more pushy in bringing in our ip . " .
seamicro currently employs 80 people , and about half of them are engineers .
one of those engineers is founder and chief technology officer gary lauterbach , who was previously an amd fellow and one of five architects who build the core of amd " s opteron processor .
lauterbach was also a lead chip designer at sun microsystems , and the idea for seamicro first came to him when he and another sun executive got a look at the low - power servers that powered google " s search engine in the early part of the last decade .
andrew feldman will become the general manager of amd " s new " data center solutions " business .
according to su , this business unit will continue to support the current " roadmap " for seamicro " s servers .
this means that the company will sell and service seamicro " s intel atom and intel xeon systems -- though su indicated that the company will eventually drop intel " s chips .
she said that amd opteron chips will be added to seamicro system " towards the end of this year . " .
intel " s jason waxman -- who heads the company " s general manager of intel " s high density computing group -- tells wired that amd " s acquisition of seamicro " doesn " t change a whole lot " for intel .
he says that amd will decide whether to keep selling seamicro servers with intel chips , and that intel will continue to reduce the power consumption of both its xeon and atom chips for use inside servers .
" being able to launch the seamicro product with intel xeon silicon was a good testimonial for us .
they thought we were the best partner at the time , " waxman said .
" they chose our silicon for a reason . " .
whatever the fate of intel chips in seamicro servers , amd says the acquisition is about more than just selling machines .
the idea is also to " broaden " amd " s relationships with server sellers such as dell and hp .
presumably , this means that amd will license seamicro " s fabric technology to third - parties .
" we have new technology that we can add to our existing opteron roadmap to form something that can really differentiate us in the marketplace , " su said .
andrew feldman added that seamicro has already had discussions along these lines with the likes of dell and hp .
currently , dell resells seamicro servers .
that said , the acquisition means that -- on some level -- amd will be competing with its own customers .
it will be both chip designer and server maker .
but su downplayed this notion .
" we are not competing with our customers .
we have to balance the fact that will continue to support [ seamicro's ] products .
but the goal is to proliferate the technology with oems , " su said , referring to original equipment manufacturers such as dell and hp .
" what we saw was a chance to take our technology to multiple markets , with multiple partners , in multiple geographies -- in ways we couldn " t do on our own , " said seamicro ceo and new amd general manager andrew feldman .
" the opportunity to collaborate with the oems was larger than the opportunity to compete with them . " .
