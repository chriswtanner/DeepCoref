gov. sarah palin 's home church was badly damaged by arson , leading ms. palin to apologize if the fire was connected to 'undeserved negative attention ' the church received during her campaign as the republican vice-presidential nominee .
damage to the wasilla bible church was estimated at $ 1 million , authorities said saturday .
no one was injured in the fire , which was set friday night while a handful of people , including two children , were inside , according to the central mat-su fire chief , james steele .
chief steele said that the blaze was being investigated as an arson but that he did not know of any recent threats to the church .
the authorities also did not know whether ms. palin 's connection to the church was relevant to the fire , he said .
chief steele would not comment on the means used to set the fire .
the church 's pastor , larry kroon , declined to say whether the church had received any recent threats .
ms. palin , who was not at the church at the time of the fire , stopped by saturday .
her spokesman , bill mcallister , said in a statement that the alaska governor told an assistant pastor she was sorry if the fire was connected to her candidacy .
" whatever the motives of the arsonist , " mr. mcallister said , " the governor has faith in the scriptural passage that what was intended for evil will in some way be used for good . " .
the 1,000-member evangelical church was the subject of intense scrutiny after ms. palin was named senator john mccain 's running mate .
early in her campaign , the church was criticized for promoting in a sunday bulletin a focus on the family " love won out conference " in anchorage .
the conference promised to " help men and women dissatisfied with living homosexually understand that same-sex attractions can be overcome . " .
the fire was set at the entrance of the church and moved inward as a small group of women were working on crafts , chief steele said .
the group was alerted to the fire by an alarm .
outside temperatures were minus 20 as firefighters battled the blaze .
