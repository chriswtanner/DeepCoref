obama overturns bush endangered species rule .
president obama on tuesday overturned a last - minute bush administration regulation that many environmentalists claim weakened the endangered species act .
the regulation , issued a few weeks before george w . bush left office , made it easier for federal agencies to skip consultations with government scientists before launching projects that could affect endangered wildlife .
by overturning the regulation , obama said during an enthusiastic reception at the interior department , he had restored "the scientific process to its rightful place at the heart of the endangered species act , a process undermined by past administrations . " .
under the bush administration rule , there was no need for a federal agency to consult with the u . s . fish and wildlife service or the national marine fisheries services if that agency determined that no harm would come to an endangered species as a result of its project .
but the determination of what "no harm" meant rested with agency bureaucrats instead of scientists .
obama issued a memorandum that effectively suspends the regulation while ordering a review to determine whether it promotes "the purposes of the [ endangered species act ] . " .
"the work of scientists and experts in my administration , including right here in the interior department , will be respected , " obama said .
"for more than three decades , the endangered species act has successfully protected our nation's most threatened wildlife , and we should be looking for ways to improve it , not weaken it . " .
environmental groups were quick to praise obama's action .
"president obama's announcement will allow [ the endangered species act ] to do what it was intended : protect our nation's endangered plants and animals , " said andrew wetzler , director of the natural resources defense council's endangered species program .
"reversing the bush administration's midnight action will restore protections for our last wild places and species . " .
obama also helped celebrate the 160th anniversary of the interior department on tuesday .
"throughout our history , there's been a tension between those who've sought to conserve our natural resources for the benefit of future generations and those who have sought to profit from these resources , " he told department employees .
"but i'm here to tell you this is a false choice .
with smart , sustainable policies , we can grow our economy today and preserve the environment for ourselves , our children and our grandchildren . " .
