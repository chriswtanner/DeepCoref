published : april 10 , 2007 .
a man who was fired last week from his job at an accounting firm in suburban detroit walked into his former office with a shotgun on monday and shot three people , killing one , before fleeing and leading police officers on a high - speed chase , the authorities said .
the suspect , identified as anthony lacalamita , entered the second - floor office of the accounting firm , gordon advisors , about 10 a . m . and opened fire , the police said .
a 63 - year - old woman and two men , ages 47 and 48 , were shot , the police said .
the woman , identified by the police as madeline kafoury , died at the scene , the authorities said .
the two other victims were being treated at beaumont hospital in royal oak .
ilene wolff , a spokeswoman for the hospital , said that their families had requested privacy , and that the hospital was not releasing any information about their condition or the nature of their injuries .
though the police declined to release the names of the two men , the detroit free press identified them as paul riva , 47 , of sterling heights and alan steinberg , 48 , of bruce township .
both are partners in the firm , the newspaper reported .
mr . lacalamita , 38 , who was still listed on the firm " s web site as a member of its " professional staff , " had been dismissed last week , the police said .
though they would not say what his relationship was with any of the victims or what led to the shootings , " it doesn " t appear it was random , " the troy police chief , charles craft , said .
officers and witnesses described a chaotic scene immediately after the shooting as workers barricaded themselves in their cubicles and offices .
a few hours later , some employees gathered outside the building but would not speak to reporters .
the three - story office building houses other tenants in addition to the accounting firm , and appeared to have no formal security system , chief craft said .
he said witnesses told the police that mr . lacalamita had walked into the building and into the firm " s unlocked suite as though he were concealing something .
mr . lacalamita fled in his car before officers arrived , but witnesses took note of the license plate number , the authorities said .
about two hours after the shooting , officers received a tip from a motorist in flint , about 50 miles north of here , on the whereabouts of the car .
police officers chased mr . lacalamita for about 30 miles at speeds of up to 120 miles an hour on interstate 75 before apprehending him near bay city .
