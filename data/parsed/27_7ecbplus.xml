microsoft will push out an out - of - cycle windows patch to temporarily fix the critical internet explorer flaw revealed earlier this week .
"while we have only seen a few attempts to exploit the issue , impacting an extremely limited number of people , we are taking this proactive step to help ensure internet explorer customers are protected and able to safely browse online , " microsoft trustworthy computing director yunsun wee said in a blog posting on sept . 18 .
"the fix it is an easy - to - use , one - click , full - strength solution any internet explorer user can install , " wee wrote .
"it will not affect your ability to browse the web , and it will provide full protection against this issue until an update is available .
it won " t require a reboot of your computer .
"this fix it will be available for everyone to download and install within the next few days , " she added .
microsoft usually pushes out software updates and security patches on the second tuesday of every month .
out - of - cycle patches are reserved for the most serious flaws .
it's not clear what exactly microsoft has in mind , if , as wee indicates , the "fix it" is not a real update .
microsoft initially suggested that all internet explorer users install and configure a utility called the enhanced mitigation experience toolkit ( emet ) to prevent exploitation of the flaw , but admitted emet might interfere with other applications .
most security experts , and the german government , have recommended a simpler solution : stop using internet explorer entirely until the flaw is fully fixed .
the internet explorer vulnerability allows an attacker to gain remote control of a windows machine at the same level of privilege as the current user .
that's not so bad if a given machine's current user has limited privileges , but very serious if the current user has administrator rights and can install , modify or delete software .
the flaw affects all currently distributed and supported versions of internet explorer and windows : internet explorer versions 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 and windows xp , vista and 7 , as well as windows server 2003 , and 2008 .
windows 8 , due to be released to the general public oct . 26 , and its accompanying web browser , internet explorer 10 , are not affected .
nor is windows server 2012 .
