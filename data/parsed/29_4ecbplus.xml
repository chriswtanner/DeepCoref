the indianapolis colts clinched a playoff spot and the five seed in the afc playoffs with a 20 - 13 win over the kansas city chiefs on another andrew luck game - winning drive , his seventh of the season .
a year ago , the indianapolis colts were an nfl - worst 2 - 14 and did not figure to be much better this season .
but fifteen games later and the colts stand at 10 - 5 and in the playoffs as the afc's five seed .
it is the representation of an incredible sesaon that will be extended beyond just next week .
the colts got the win today , but it wasn't pretty .
in fact , according to pro football reference , it was the first time in nfl history that a team rushed for over 350 yards and lost the game .
the colts were outplayed on both sides of the ball , but when it counted andrew luck and the colts got it done .
check out some notes from the game .
andrew luck was terrible for a stretch in the game that included 10 straight incompletions .
but after that he got hot at just the right time and hit his last 6 passes of the day , capped off by a 7 - yard touchdown pass to reggie wayne in the back of the end zone for what proved to be the game winning score with four minutes left .
he ended the day 17 / 35 for 205 yards and the touchdown along with 6 carries for 21 yards .
for the second week in a row he did not turn the ball over , which is huge .
and he also set the nfl rookie record for most passing yards in a season with 4 , 051 yards - breaking cam newton's record set a year ago .
dwayne allen also set a colts rookie record for receptions by a tight end with 43 .
allen has had a tremendous rookie year .
he has a bright future ahead of him .
cassius vaughn and pat angerer both were terrible today .
there were others as well , but those two were the ones that really stuck out .
basically , however , the whole defense stunk today .
the colts gave up 507 total yards , 352 of them on the ground .
it was the worst run defense i have seen the colts play since that now infamous debacle in jacksonville in 2006 .
simply must improve .
that said , the colts won the turnover battle 3 - 0 over the chiefs .
darius butler picked off a terrible brady quinn throw and took it back 32 yards for a score .
it was butler's 4th pick of the year and the 2nd one he returned for a touchdown .
pat angerer also forced a big fumble with the chiefs in the red zone and threatening that led to 3 points for the colts before the half .
and then the 3rd turnover was a pick by vontae davis .
when you have a +3 turnover differential , you are going to win most games .
it will be huge if the colts could keep that up .
the wide receivers really didn't help out andrew luck today .
they dropped several passes ( reggie wayne included ) and failed to get open numerous other times .
while it looked like a bad game from luck , i place more of the blame on the receivers in this one .
nothing was open .
however , on the final drive , once reggie wayne started getting involved , the colts started rolling .
on the last drive he caught 3 passes for 37 yards and a touchdown .
prior to that he had caught 2 passes for 44 .
the key was that once the colts got reggie involved , good things happened .
this game was andrew luck's 7th game - winning drive of the season , tying an nfl record - not just a rookie record .
peyton manning did it twice .
incredibly , if luck leads a game winning drive next week in a very winnable game for the colts , he would have the nfl record all to himself - as a rookie .
added to that fact is that the colts are 8 - 1 in games decided by one score or less - the only loss coming in week 3 on that last - minute 80 yard touchdown pass by the jaguars after luck had led another go - ahead scoring drive late in the 4th quarter .
chuck pagano returns tomorrow .
what a moment that will be tomorrow when pagano walks into the locker room and is handed the head coaching reigns once again .
and what a moment that will be next sunday when he takes the field for the first time since week 3 .
colts nation has supported him all the way , as has the nfl .
next sunday , the division rival houston texans come to lucas oil stadium having never won in indy .
this is a game that before the season i even thought the colts would win - back when i thought they would get 7 wins all year .
they can beat the texans , and with pagano coming back , that will be a special game .
great job , bruce arians .
tremendous .
now my piece of advice to the colts - don't stop being chuckstrong .
pagano certainly won't .
