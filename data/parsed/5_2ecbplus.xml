mo cheeks will take over as new coach .

maurice cheeks is running the show again for the philadelphia 76ers .
in a surprising move nearly three weeks following the end of their season , the sixers fired jim o'brien on monday after one season as coach and replaced him with cheeks , one of the most popular players in franchise history .
"mo is family .
mo bleeds 76ers . he bleeds philadelphia , " team president billy king said .
cheeks will be introduced as philadelphia's 21st head coach at a tuesday news conference .
philadelphia is certainly banking on the former point guard to have a happier homecoming than o'brien , a philadelphia native who played for saint joseph's .
o'brien's stubbornness and seemingly unwavering belief in a system that didn't fit his players cost him his job despite a 43 - 39 record and a return to the playoffs .
"i just felt the direction we were going and the overall play wasn't where we wanted to go , " king said .
o'brien just finished the first year of a three - year deal that included an option and paid him about $4 million a year .
o'brien , though , was not very popular with his players - - most notably former all - star chris webber - - who often complained about their roles .
king said after the sixers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by detroit that he planned to bring o'brien back .
after meeting with his players and other members of management , king had a change of heart and decided over the weekend he had to make a change .
certainly , king knows a thing or two about making changes - - cheeks will be the fifth sixers coach in four years under his watch .
larry brown left for detroit following the 2002 - 03 season , and assistant randy ayers was promoted and fired 52 games into the 2003 - 04 season before he was replaced by chris ford .
"i knew this thing was coming , and it wasn't an easy thing for anybody , " brown said from miami before coaching the pistons in the eastern conference finals .
"knowing billy , it's not easy to let a coach go .
his relationship with randy was pretty strong .
i think it was hard for him to let chris go .
he was excited about having jimmy , but i don't think it ever gets easy . " .
cheeks was one of the most popular 76ers from 1978 - 89 and played on philadelphia's last championship team in 1983 .
he also spent seven seasons as an assistant coach for the 76ers , was part of the staff under brown when they went to the nba finals in 2001 and developed a strong bond with allen iverson .
cheeks was fired march 2 after nearly four seasons as coach of the trail blazers .
he had a 162 - 139 record in portland , the fourth - highest win total in blazers history .
cheeks guided the team to the playoffs his first two seasons , but the players hardly made cheeks' tenure easy - - on or off the court .
the team was nicknamed the "jail blazers" after several brushes with the law , many of them involving marijuana possession .
"if players have problems with mo cheeks . . . then there's got to be something wrong with those players , " king said .
but cheeks' return to the city where he was a four - time all - star shouldn't come as a surprise .
the trail blazers turned down philadelphia's request to speak to cheeks as a possible replacement for brown , but the former point guard always remained popular with philly fans and was at the top of the sixers' short list to take over for ford .
now , they'll get their wish .
"we do not want to change coaches [ again ] , " sixers chairman ed snider said .
"we've seen enough coaches . " .
the sixers will pay ayers , o'brien and cheeks next season .
"i don't think it's something we're very proud of , but i don't think it reflects poorly , " snider said .
o'brien is the son - in - law of hall of fame coach jack ramsay .
he led the sixers to a 10 - win improvement from a year ago and they returned to the playoffs , largely on the back of a healthy , happy iverson .
while o'brien avoided public spats with iverson , he did not have the full support of the rest of the team .
some of the younger players , like samuel dalembert and willie green , felt they did not develop like they should have under o'brien and were unsure about their roles .
"in looking at the development of some of them , yeah , i wasn't pleased , " king said .
the sixers also failed to really understand o'brien's defense , a sticking point even in the postseason .
"some of the criteria on our defense wasn't there , " king said .
cheeks , who once famously came to the rescue of a 13 - year - old girl who forgot the words to the national anthem before a playoff game , now hopes to bail out his former team and bring them another championship .
"mo has played this game here in philadelphia , won a championship here in philadelphia , understands players , understands defenses , understands the way i think we want to play , " king said .
