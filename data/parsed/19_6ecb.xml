a sanctuary for dissent in greece ?
greek law keeps police away from universities , but some fear the immunity clause meant to protect free speech is now being used to harbor bastions of violence .
masked men wielding clubs guard the entrance to the athens polytechnic university , keeping watch over the graffiti-covered walls on campus .
nearby streets are barricaded with the carcasses of burnt cars , and a huge black banner proclaims " murderers " - the rallying cry that has brought greece 's youths to the streets .
inside , piles of empty gas canisters testify to the scores of molotov cocktails assembled there recently .
for more than a week , athenian streets have been a battleground between police and protesters , whose anger was sparked by the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy by a policeman .
protected by greece 's constitution from police interference , the polytechnic has become the headquarters of the protest movement - and a haven for those wreaking havoc on the city 's streets .
as greeks try to make sense of the chaos - and prepare for another week of protests , ranging from sit-ins to nationwide roadblocks - many here are beginning to ask whether the asylum law is protecting free speech or simply harboring criminals .
" the university asylum is for the freedom of movement of ideas , but not of commitment of criminal actions , " says george bergeles , a professor at the polytechnic who is sympathetic to the students ' complaints , but not their harsh tactics .
" the law about university asylum i believe is a fantastic achievement of the university movement , but we should protect it by not allowing criminal offenses to happen inside . " .
the polytechnic holds historic importance for greeks .
in november 1973 , students barricaded themselves inside in rebellion against the country 's military junta , which had been in power since 1967 .
fearful that the revolt would spread , on nov. 17 the national police moved in with tanks , killing a still-disputed number of protesters .
the junta fell less than a year later .
greece 's new constitution gave special status to universities and other schools , forever barring the police from entering their grounds .
today , the poly-technic and other institutions of learning are once again brimming with revolutionary zeal .
across athens , high schools and universities are under occupation by students and other youth angry at the dec. 6 killing of alexandros grigoropoulos and also at a political system they see as corrupt and incompetent .
so far , prime minister costas karamanlis has rejected calls by opposition leaders to hold early elections , but his center-right party holds only a one-seat majority in parliament , and public support for his government was weak even before the riots .
the latest poll numbers show a 20 percent approval rating .
the polytechnic , which lies on the border of the edgy neighborhood of exarchia , where the 15-year-old was killed , is serving as the heart and brain center of the revolt .
there , anarchists - many of whom call exarchia their home - are helping to organize students and other young people .
the area just outside its gates has been the site of some of the most intense clashes with police .
inside , protesters regroup and rearm around bonfires that burn through the night .
there 's an air of menace outside the polytechnic .
but stergia sarantopoulou , an architecture student there who has been participating in protests , says the mood is angry but collegial .
like many students , she passionately defends the asylum law .
" there are historical , political , ideological reasons for the immunity to exist , " she says .
" universities are our home .
it 's the students home ; it 's the teachers home . " .
the university safe-haven policy might at times be abused , ms. sarantopoulou says , but in the long run society is better off by having a law that forever ensures a safe place for free speech .
" it 's much more harmful for the state to control [ universities , ] " she says .
the explosion of rioting and looting that took place in the aftermath of alexandros 's death has faded in recent days , but there are still daily protests , many of which end in hails of rocks and flaming molotov cocktails .
on saturday , the one-week anniversary of the shooting , the protests were largely peaceful , though still angry .
in daylight , a fragile normality began to return to the city center , with shops again opening and people returning to work .
but at night , uncertain athenians stayed away from the normally bustling city center , which was ghostly quiet .
groups of young people roamed the streets across central athens , shouting .
" this night is for alexi ! " .
a heavy cloud of tear gas and smoke hung over exarchia , which felt like a rebel-held enclave in a city at war .
police lingered warily on its edges as young people set up burning barricades and attacked government buildings and banks .
and clashes erupted once again outside the polytechnic .
few here think the unrest will end anytime soon , and the rage of greece 's youth continues to smolder .
the death of alexandros 's has tapped into anger about a range of broader complaints - about corruption , nepotism , a failing education system , and the poor economic prospects of young people , including unemployment rates in the 25 percent range .
protests are expected to continue throughout the week , with activists calling for roads to be blocked nationwide on tuesday .
they say they want to bring down greece 's whole political system - it 's not just the current government that is seen as tainted , most believe the main opposition is little better .
the protesters , however , struggle to articulate exactly what they want in its place .
" do n't bend your head down , " they chanted as they confronted police recently in front of parliament .
" the only way is resistance . " .
