09 / 10 / 10 08 : 23 pm et .
a kraft foods plant worker who had been suspended for feuding with colleagues , then escorted from the building , returned minutes later with a handgun , found her foes in a break room and executed two of them with a single bullet each and critically wounded a third , police said friday .
yvonne hiller , 43 , had gotten into an argument thursday evening with her co - workers at the northeast philadelphia plant , police said .
after she was disciplined , she went to her vehicle , made several phone calls , and then grabbed a . 357 magnum and used it to force her way past security guards at the front gate .
about 100 people were at work at the plant , which makes nabisco cookies and crackers .
hiller walked to the third - floor mixing area and found four people in the break room .
she had no quarrels with one woman and told her to leave .
she then opened fire on the others , philadelphia homicide capt . james clark said .
"she believed they were spraying chemicals at her , saying things behind her back , " clark said .
after leaving the break room , hiller went down a hallway and fired shots at the supervisor who had suspended her and at a mechanic who was using a walkie - talkie to alert police and co - workers to her whereabouts , police said .
she missed both .
hiller finally went to a second - floor office and called police to tell them what she had done , authorities said .
seven other workers were hiding in a closet nearby .
cpl . janice leader , a 911 dispatcher , told reporters friday that hiller called 911 , saying "i'm the one you're looking for" and reporting that she had been harassed at work .
keeping her on the line , leader said she told hiller to put the gun down and place her hands on her head so officers wouldn't take any aggressive action against her .
when tactical police who had entered the plant found her , hiller was in a fetal position on the floor , the gun beside her .
police called the mechanic a hero who "did a phenomenal job" in alerting employees to evacuate the building and directing officers to where hiller was .
"by following the suspect at great peril to himself -- and we can see that by the fact that he was shot at and almost hit -- he reduced our tactical problem quite dramatically , " chief inspector joe sullivan said .
police identified the victims as tanya renee wilson , 47 ; latonya sharon brown , 36 ; and bryant a . dalton , 39 , all of philadelphia .
wilson and brown died at the plant .
dalton , shot in the neck , remained in intensive care friday at jefferson university hospital , police said .
the plant will remain closed indefinitely , kraft said .
"we suspended the employee when she became agitated and used profanity .
we wanted the opportunity to investigate the situation , " kraft said in a statement friday .
hiller was charged with two counts of murder , one count of attempted murder , aggravated assault and other charges .
she had a permit to carry the gun , authorities said .
hiller has worked for kraft for about 15 years , and had been in repeated arguments there in the past several years , a few of them physical , clark said .
yet a next - door neighbor described hiller as a quiet woman who kept to herself but said she was polite and exchanged pleasantries when they saw each other .
catherine hillgen , who has lived on the tidy middle - class city block for about 45 years , said hiller moved in several years ago with her son but recently has been living alone .
she initially dismissed a neighbor's report thursday that hiller might be involved in a fatal workplace shooting , but then heard her named on the news friday .
"it was a complete shock , " hillgen said .
"i would not expect it . " .
kraft , based in northfield , ill . , also makes oreo cookies , philadelphia cream cheese , oscar mayer bacon and other products .
mass shootings are rarely carried out by women , said dr . park dietz , president of threat assessment group inc . , a newport beach , calif . - based violence prevention firm .
earlier this year , amy bishop , a former instructor and researcher at the university of alabama's huntsville campus , was charged with murder in a campus shooting spree that left three biology professors dead and three other employees wounded .
she claimed the shootings "didn't happen . " .
thursday's shooting came just weeks after a driver who had been accused of stealing from a manchester , conn . , beer distributorship fatally shot eight people , then himself .
the driver , who was black , had seethed with a sense of racial injustice in his job , said his girlfriend .
but the beer distributor's president said there was no record to support claims of "racial insensitivity . " .
