an israeli mortar strike that killed about 40 palestinians sheltering in a un school tuesday brought new urgency to diplomatic efforts to end israel 's military onslaught in the gaza strip , as the un security council met to discuss the crisis .
with the conflict now having taken more than 600 lives and aid agencies warning of a deepening humanitarian crisis in gaza-where large areas are without power and water .
israel said early wednesday that it would suspend attacks in some areas so a " humanitarian corridor " could be created to deliver vital supplies .
the israeli army said the un school in the jabaliya refugee camp was hit when troops responded to a mortar attack from the grounds and that the dead included a number of hamas militants .
a military spokesman said he had no information on whether troops had identified the hundreds of civilians in the school compound before they returned fire .
the carnage appeared to intensify international efforts to arrange a cease-fire after 11 days of a punishing israeli offensive against hamas , just as deadly strikes on civilians in previous conflicts with guerrillas in lebanon raised pressure on israel to halt hostilities .
in the 2006 lebanon war , 28 lebanese civilians were killed in an israeli bombing in the village of qana , and a shelling that killed more than 100 lebanese sheltering in a un compound in the same village hastened the end of a major israeli assault on hezbollah in 1996 .
at the security council on tuesday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner urged support for a cease-fire plan announced in egypt by president hosni mubarak and french president nicolas sarkozy .
u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice welcomed the initiative but told the council that any agreement must halt rocket attacks from gaza and arms smuggling into the hamas-ruled territory .
israel has insisted that any truce must ensure that hamas can not re-arm .
the mortar strike in jabaliya was the second attack on a school run by the un relief and works agency , or unrwa .
in an earlier airstrike , three cousins who had taken refuge with hundreds of other people in a un school were killed .
an israeli army spokesman said he had no information about the incident .
shifa hospital , gaza 's main medical center , said 42 people were killed in the jabaliya school , where more than 300 palestinians had taken shelter from fighting around their homes .
the un said earlier that it had confirmed 30 dead and 55 wounded , 15 critically .
" there 's nowhere safe in gaza , " said john ging , the head of unrwa in gaza , after the first school was hit .
" everyone here is terrorized and traumatized . " .
the un said some 14,000 palestinians displaced from their homes were in emergency shelters .
unrwa spokesman christopher gunness said that the schools hit were clearly marked with a un flag and that the gps coordinates of all un installations in gaza had been given some time ago to the israelis .
he said unrwa wants an impartial probe of the israeli strike that could also determine whether militants had used the school for a mortar attack .
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni told reporters she was unfamiliar with details of the jabaliya incident but " unfortunately , [ hamas militants ] are hiding among civilians . " .
mohammad awad , hospitalized with shrapnel wounds in the legs and face , said he had come to the school with his family after his house was destroyed in the bombing of a neighboring home of a hamas leader .
he said he and other men had been sitting in the schoolyard when shells hit the compound .
" i saw bodies flying and people torn to pieces , " he said .
majed hamdan , an associated press photographer , said that at the local hospital , " i saw women and men-parents-slapping their faces in grief , screaming , some of them collapsed to the floor .
they knew their children were dead . " .
umm ibrahim , a hospitalized woman , said she had lost an 8-year-old daughter and two sons , 11 and 14. she said she had come to the school after a phone warning from the israelis that the family house would be struck because one son was a hamas militant .
" we escaped death in our house , but it pursued us to the school , " she said .
" what can we do ?
where should we go ? " .
in an earlier israeli strike in the zeitoun neighborhood of gaza city , at least 12 members of the extended daya family were killed when their house collapsed after it was hit by missiles , medical officials and a surviving relative said .
other family members were missing and feared dead in the rubble .
the army said it was checking the report .
