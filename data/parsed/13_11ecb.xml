authorities are now saying they suspect arson is to blame for friday night 's fire at wasilla bible church , where gov. sarah palin and her family attend .
it 's a sad day when the hate , anger and vengeful actions of a few overshadow our people here in alaska .
we do n't know if the fire is the result of radicals angry with palin , but we do know our governor has not been treated fairly .
for months i have been reading the lies about our first family of alaska .
i had to endure watching on tv an appalling effigy of gov. palin , part of a halloween display in a yard in southern california .
the governor of california did nothing , the mayor did nothing , and the neighbors thought it was " cool . " .
this effigy was a likeness of a woman swinging by a noose in someone 's yard !
where was the outrage ?
then there are those who have blasted the governor for her daughter 's pregnancy .
both have been brutally criticized , belittled and shamed .
children will do what they want as teenagers ; .
we parents try our best to instill good morals and values .
palin 's daughter 's upbringing has nothing to do with who our governor is or what she believes .
i was appalled to hear comments like , " well , she put herself in the limelight , so she deserved what she got . " .
there have also been those who have asked if the governor is really trig 's mom ?
where has the fair and balanced reporting been on that " story " ?
it is one thing to disagree with sarah palin 's views or beliefs , but to tear her and her family apart to make you feel more superior , to make you feel good about your hatred , anger and lack of christianity , that is appalling .
i do hope palin 's church was not torched because of her beliefs .
she and her family have never done anything to warrant the outlandish actions from her insensitive critics .
