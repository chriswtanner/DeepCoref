a 4.2 magnitude earthquake shook a remote area of eastern sonoma county on sunday morning , the largest in a flurry over the weekend , according to the u.s. geological survey .
the temblor occurred at 9:27 a.m. , 13 miles east of cloverdale and 2 miles southeast of the geysers , where geothermal forces by more than 20 power plants are harnessed to provide energy for several north bay counties .
according to the usgs , the area has no fault , but the pumping of water from plants into the ground periodically induces small temblors .
the size of sunday morning 's earthquake caught the attention of people in cobb , a small community along highway 175 in lake county , 4 miles east of the geysers .
" shaking is n't uncommon here , but this was a pretty good jolt , " said james gaskell , manager of hardester 's grocery .
the only products to fall off shelves were q-tip boxes and mayonnaise , but " our wine rattled pretty good . " .
down the road at brick oven pizza , which opens for breakfast on weekends , " it caught our attention , " said geri angel , a waitress .
" we have teacup rattlers all the time , but pans were swinging for this one . " .
