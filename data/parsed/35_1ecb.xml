chargers wr jackson will play vs. steelers .
an arrest for suspicion of driving under the influence will not affect the playing status of san diego chargers wide receiver vincent jackson for sunday 's divisional playoff game at pittsburgh .
jackson was arrested on the dui charge early tuesday morning by the california highway patrol .
however , the fourth-year wide receiver likely will not face disciplinary action until the 2009 season .
an nfl spokesman on wednesday said the league will await a determination by the court before considering disciplinary action against jackson .
along with the misdemeanor dui allegation , california highway patrol officer brad baehr said jackson was cited for driving on probation for a prior dui .
jackson issued a statement released through the team .
" i was stopped by an officer , " he said .
" i do n't think any charges will be filed as a result of the stop .
in the event they are , i look forward to clearing my name and proving my innocence . " .
baehr said he was not aware of the particulars of the previous dui charge and that results of jackson 's blood test are pending .
jackson had his finest season in 2008 with with 59 receptions for 1,098 yards and seven touchdowns for the afc west champions .
" we 're aware of the off-the-field issue involving vincent , " team general manager a.j. smith said in a statement .
" obviously we 're disappointed .
we take these issues very seriously .
moving forward , we will monitor the situation and have no further comment . " .
