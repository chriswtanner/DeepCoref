if only he 'll wear those gold lame pants .
as word got out friday that hugh jackman will be this year 's oscar host , a clip from the 2004 tony telecast of his performance from " the boy from oz " made the rounds .
if you happened to miss the 2004 tonys , jackman , playing the flamboyant australian songwriter peter allen , sang , danced and writhed his way across the stage in a leopard skin top and skin-tight gold lame pants .
will the oscar gift baskets include smelling salts ?
jackman , who has hosted the tonys several times and won an emmy for doing so in 2005 , certainly knows how to hold a stage -- he won a tony for " the boy from oz " -- and by choosing him , first-time oscar producers laurence mark and bill condon are betting that broadway can do what comedy could not .
previous hosts -- jon stewart , ellen degeneres , chris rock -- all followed the traditional stand-up model and the ratings have steadily soured .
obviously a change is required , and though i would lean toward thinking " television " rather than " broadway " ( why , i even wrote a piece about it , for this coming sunday 's calendar , before the host choice was announced ) , jackman is , of course , another way to go .
clearly mark and condon are less concerned with solving the ratings crisis as they are with creating a new vibe for the show .
jackman may have more talent in his little finger than most of us do in our entire bodies , but he does n't have the fan base of degeneres or rock .
if you are among the thousands who loved his hosting of the tonys , you 're probably not only watching the oscars anyway , you 're hosting your own annual oscar party .
yes , jackman was just named people 's sexiest man alive , and yes , he is wolverine of " x-men " but do we want wolverine hosting the oscars ?
probably not .
otherwise , jackman 's movie career has been less than memorable , capped by this year 's box office dud " australia . " .
and as last season 's mercifully short-lived " viva laughlin " proved , one talented person does not a television show make .
or at least not a good television show .
but mark and condon are the team that brought us " dreamgirls , " which actually makes jackman an obvious choice .
there 's nothing wrong with a big broadway-esque opener similar to billy crystal 's famous musical clips , but with more hip action .
beyond that , however , it gets a little worrisome .
the oscars have a prickly relationship with singin ' and dancin ' and as anyone who saw rosie o'donnell 's recent disaster knows , nothing fails bigger than a failed variety show .
what jackman does have in his favor is an unapologetic , unabashed love for , and understanding of , theater .
he is n't snarky and he is n't an outsider .
he is a from-the-bottom-of-his-heart performer who seems utterly happy and at ease in front of an audience .
no doubt those in the kodak will enjoy an energetic and dazzling evening .
how it will play on television remains to be seen .
but maybe it 's time we stopped caring about that so much .
