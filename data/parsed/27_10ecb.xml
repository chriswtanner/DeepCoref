microsoft releases critical patch for ie zero day flaw .
microsoft ( nsdq : msft ) issued an out-of-band emergency patch wednesday for a zero-day internet explorer vulnerability that has opened the door for hackers to install malware on susceptible computers without any user intervention .
the flaw , which is given the highest severity rating of critical , affects all versions of microsoft 's ie web browser .
specifically , microsoft 's ie update affects versions of windows 2000 for ie 5.01 : xp , xp professional , server 2003 for ie 6 ; and xp , server 2003 , vista , server 2008 for ie 7 .
the vulnerability was reported after the release of windows ie 8 beta 2 , but microsoft still recommends in its advisory that users apply the patch .
the ie security problem is the result of a fundamental flaw in the browser 's data binding function , which ultimately leaves a hole in the memory space that can be accessed by remote hackers .
internet explorer can then quit unexpectedly while in an exploitable state .
unlike other exploits , users have only to visit a malicious site infused with trojans or other malware in order to become infected .
hackers can also entice victims to visit a specially crafted site , usually via some kind of phishing or social engineering scheme , or place infected banner ads on legitimate web sites .
once users open an infected web page , malicious downloaders are then installed on their computers , which are designed to record keystrokes and steal passwords , credit card numbers , or other financial information .
the users ' computer could also become part of a botnet , an infected network of compromised computers , operated by a central command and control center .
security researchers first saw evidence of attacks exploiting the ie vulnerability last week , shortly following microsoft 's " patch tuesday " monthly security bulletin release dec. 9 .
since then , researchers have seen active exploitation rapidly spread in the wild .
while exact numbers of victims are difficult to precisely calculate , the number of infected computers could potentially affect hundreds of thousands or millions of computers , experts say .
" there 're people constantly looking at the code , trying to find issues like ( the ie vulnerability ) , " said dave marcus , security research and communications manager for mcafee .
" it gets posted to the internet very quickly . " .
mcafee avert labs researchers reported variants of the ie exploit that attempt to infect users via an activex control that stores the malicious exploit code , stealthily running in the background of a microsoft word document .
malware is then installed on the vulnerable computer once users open up a word document -- all without their knowledge or permission .
" we 've seen some pretty clever ways of people trying to take advantage of this , " said marcus .
" it just speaks to the fact that they look for clever , very unique ways to get malware onto your system . " .
security experts strongly recommend that users apply microsoft 's latest ie patch as soon as possible , which can be downloaded from the microsoft web site .
