lawyer : lindsay lohan checks into rehab facility .
updated 4 : 08 p . m . et .
lindsay lohan's attorney said thursday the actress checked into a southern california rehab facility that a state official said is unlicensed to perform the type of treatment a judge required her to receive .
mark jay heller told a judge that lohan was settling in at morningside recovery , a treatment facility in newport beach .
"my client is ensconced in the bosom of that facility right now , " heller argued after a prosecutor objected to lohan's choice of rehab facilities .
"she's in rehab right now .
nothing bad is going to happen . " .
tmz reported lohan was shopping at an electronics store while her attorney was in court , and that she never entered morningside .
white said he was "completely blindsided" by lohan's placement at morningside because heller had previously agreed to send the actress to a different facility that had been vetted .
