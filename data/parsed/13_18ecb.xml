sarah palin 's family will have to attend church in a local school this morning after a fire ripped through her church on friday evening .
the fire , estimated to have caused $ 1 million in damages to the wasilla bible church , has been labeled " suspicious " by james steele , chief of the central mat-su fire department .
steele told the anchorage daily news that investigators are looking at the cause of the blaze as " potential arson " and said it was too early to link the fire to the exposure the church received as a result of palin 's vice-presidential run .
" right now there 's no indication that we have that there 's any connection there .
we just do n't have any leads at all as far as the intent or motive in this , " steele said .
the fire , the largest of the year for the department , " was was set at the entrance of the church " according to the associated press and was battled by firefighters for nearly eight hours before it was fully extinguished .
reports are that five women were inside the building at the time of the fire .
no one was injured .
governor palin visited the church on saturday and her office later released a statement .
" gov. palin stopped by the church this morning , and she told an assistant pastor that she apologizes if the incident is in any way connected to the undeserved negative attention the church has received since she became a vice-presidential candidate on aug. 29 .
whatever the motives of the arsonist , the governor has faith in the scriptural passage that what was intended for evil will in some way be used for good . " .
palin is in juneau today , but the anchorage daily news said her children were planning on attending services at the makeshift church .
