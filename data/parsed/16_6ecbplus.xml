deputy's killer gets death sentence .
the gang member shot jerry ortiz outside a hawaiian gardens building in 2005 .
april 04 , 2007 .
a norwalk jury on tuesday ordered execution for a gang member convicted of murdering a los angeles county sheriff's deputy in june 2005 .
deputy luis gerardo "jerry" ortiz , 35 , was shot outside a hawaiian gardens apartment building while investigating jose luis orozco in connection with another shooting .
orozco , 29 , was found guilty by the same jury last month of first - degree murder with the special circumstances of murder of a police officer and possession of a firearm by a felon .
"this is the kind of person and the kind of crime that the death penalty was made for , " said dist . atty . steve cooley .
sheriff's deputy timothy brennan , who had been ortiz's partner for a year , called the verdict bittersweet .
he explained , "you feel good , but it's never going to bring jerry back to his family and friends . " .
orozco is to be formally sentenced may 3 by judge philip h . hickock .
stanley perlo , one of orozco's lawyers , said his client grew up "in a gang - infested area .
for all intents and purposes , the gang became his family . " .
perlo said orozco was consumed by gang life in much the same way one is addicted to drugs , affecting his judgment .
a 15 - year department veteran , ortiz had hoped to become a detective .
he had married two weeks before the shooting , and had won a department medal of honor for fatally shooting a suspected carjacker who had pulled a gun on him and his partner .
the jury reached its verdict in less than a day .
jurors on monday asked to review a video recording of orozco boasting about the shooting to other jail inmates two weeks after ortiz's death .
the recording , which was presented during the trial , showed orozco talking about his appearance on the "america's most wanted" television show .
