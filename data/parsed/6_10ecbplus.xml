gary ross in negotiations to direct ‘ hunger games " sequel ‘ catching fire " .
now that ‘ the hunger games " is a monster hit lionsgate are getting ready for the sequel ‘ catching fire " .
the three leads jennifer lawrence , josh hutcherson , and liam hemsworth are already signed on to appear in the sequel and , no doubt , the third film ‘ mockingjay " as well .
the biggest player who doesn " t have a deal in place is director gary ross and the hollywood reporter and collider are reporting that he is in negotiations with lionsgate to return .
hit the jump for more details and how ‘ catching fire " could face a huge delay .
allegedly , ross was paid $3 million to direct ‘ the hunger games " plus five per cent on the back end .
with no deal in place for ross to direct future films in the series , he is in a good position to ask for more money .
there is no doubt that ross was instrumental in making ‘ the hunger games " a huge success .
it was his direction that many critics applauded and brought the film down to earth , as opposed to the bloated spectacle it could have become in the wrong hands .
lionsgate can " t hide that they don " t have the money , but they have to spend it wisely to ensure the quality of the franchise continues and ross could get a good deal out of it .
of course , if ross wants too much money lionsgate could easily give him the flick and hire a new director similar to the ‘ harry potter " and ‘ twilight " films .
considering lionsgate recently absorbed summit and their executives ( masters of the ‘ twilight " films ) into team lionsgate ; a change in director could be likely .
another tough challenge facing lionsgate with the production of ‘ catching fire " is the possibility of delays due to the schedule of lawrence .
‘ catching fire " has a release date of 22 november 2013 with production starting later in the year .
lawrence is set to star in the sequel to ‘ x - men : first class " that could go into production soon if fox decide to exercise lawrence " s option to do the sequel .
the ‘ x - men : first class " sequel already has a director with matthew vaughn returning and fox might rush it into production to capitalise on lawrence " s star power .
