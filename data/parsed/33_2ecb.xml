testimony in the murder trial of an albany teen accused in the shooting death of young kathina thomas continued for the second day on wednesday .
the trial against 16 year-old jerymayne timmons started a bit late after one juror was dismissed because of a family medical emergency .
another delay in the trial was an altercation inside the courtroom .
the albany county sheriff 's department arrested one gentleman who refused to leave the courtroom after being asked to .
the man claimed someone had pushed and shoved him inside .
once the trial resumed , timmons ' 16 year-old best friend took the stand and talked about the community gun described in a police statement .
he said the .32-caliber gun was nicknamed " shaq " referencing the shaquille o'neal 's jersey number .
while on the stand he told jurors that timmons had asked him to tell police they were together until about 9 p.m. on the night of the shooting .
the teen did tell police that originally , and later confessed that he had only been playing basketball with him until about 5 : 00 on the night of may 29th .
jurors also heard testimony from a state police ballistic expert , the emergency room doctor who treated kathina , and the medical examiner who performed the autopsy .
