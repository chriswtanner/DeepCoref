nationals' eight - year offer to teixeira reportedly bumped as high as $184m .
december 23 , 2008 .
for weeks now , mark teixeira has contemplated his next home - - a waiting game that has slowly shortened the list of teams in pursuit of his services .
but evidently , the waiting hasn't caused teixeira's price tag to drop even the slightest .
one report posted online last night by masn sports' roch kubatko suggested that the washington nationals have upgraded their initial offer to teixeira - - eight years , $160 million - - to somewhere between $178 million and $184 million over the same timeframe .
no member of the team's front office would add comment yesterday on the current offer or indicate whether the team had sweetened the deal .
by way of declining to offer the numbers of washington's proposal to teixeira , team president stan kasten said , "there are bargains , but luxury goods are still not being discounted . " .
regardless of the money , the team's front office still knows it would take a mild upset for the 28 - year - old to settle on a deal with washington .
on sunday night , the los angeles angels withdrew their contract offer to teixeira , believing he had no sincere interest in playing for the organization with which he ended the 2008 season .
the boston red sox and baltimore orioles have offers on the table , and though they have yet to make a concrete offer the new york yankees might also contemplate a last - minute bid .
various news reports late last week pegged the boston offer to be as high as $184 million over eight years , though subsequent rumors suggested that the numbers are a little lower - - perhaps between $165 million and $180 million .
the orioles have the weakest offer of the bunch - - a proposal reportedly worth between $140 million and $150 million over seven years .
so far , no team involved has offered a contract longer than eight years .
teixeira's agent , scott boras , entered the free agency process hoping his client could attract a 10 - year deal .
either way , teixeira will end up with one of the biggest paydays in baseball history , almost certainly exceeding the $161 million ( over seven years ) that fellow free agent cc sabathia received from the yankees earlier this offseason .
