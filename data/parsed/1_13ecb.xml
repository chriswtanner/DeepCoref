it 's about time , right ?
perpetual mess tara reid has finally decided to try and shed her drunk-girl image and has entered rehab .
" tara reid has checked herself into promises treatment center , " her rep told usmagazine.com .
" we appreciate your respect to her and her family 's privacy at this time . " .
the actress , who has n't done anything to speak of in years , has been seen , on so many occasions , wasted out of her mind , unwittingly flashing the paparazzi on the red carpet , looking scary-skinny , and making really d-list personal appearances .
rehab has been calling her name loud and clear for years .
best decision ever .
good luck , tara .
