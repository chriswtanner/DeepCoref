violent protests in europe borne out of deeper frustrations .
they gripped rocks and stones , looking ready for a fight .
but the five young men - sons of a dentist , merchants , a state tax collector - stood in the shadow of the university of athens before another day of battle in the greek capital 's running street protests .
" what i feel when i see this , " said one young man , a hard plastic helmet covering his curly brown hair , " is that i am loving my city more than ever .
because we are all here .
because we are discussing , really , what is going on here .
the system has failed us .
the politicians failed us . " .
" i do feel bad when i see property burned , " said a man wearing ski goggles and a dark blue jacket .
" but this is a statement , a manifestation of what we see has gone wrong here . " .
for more than a week , greece has been shaken by a rebellion .
a deadly police shooting dec. 6 in athens of alexandros grigoropoulos , 15 , was killed touched off the first riots .
then something else stirred .
a coming-of-age generation from thessaloniki to athens rose up to attack dozens of police stations , occupy university campuses and prompt the closing of the international airport .
some of their demands are immediate .
they want police banned from carrying guns .
others are less defined .
they are looking for government to change .
the center-right government of costas karamanlis , increasingly unpopular amid mounting economic problems , did n't anticipate or understand how the anger had spiraled .
the youth were suddenly lashing out at all that ails greece : a weak government , an economy that remains one of the poorest of the european union and their own bleak job prospects .
they looted businesses , pelted police with stones and ran amok near government banks , offices and university campuses with molotov cocktails .
about 100 people have been injured .
property damage is an estimated $ 2 million .
talk of what happened in athens and thessaloniki has spread to italy and spain , which have had protests of their own .
few of the dozen people interviewed in athens said they had a permanent job or a job that guaranteed a pension .
many older spectators said they are sympathetic - even if they did n't like the ruin left behind .
" i feel sorry for the young , " said 40-year-old tsikala stephania , a public sector worker .
" they do n't see much of a future , and they have to show their wrath in some way . " .
