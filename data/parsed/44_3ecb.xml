hewlett-packard bets eds will fuel hot streak .
with its second-largest deal , computer giant hopes to grab bigger share of the $ 550 billion technology-services market .
riding a hot streak that has doubled its stock price in three years , hewlett-packard is rolling the dice on a $ 13.2 billion acquisition of technology services provider electronic data systems .
the all-cash deal , announced tuesday , represents hp 's biggest gamble under the leadership of mark hurd , who was hired as chief executive in march 2005 to turn around the maker of personal computers and printers .
hurd has relentlessly cut costs while demanding better execution from the company 's remaining workers .
meanwhile , hp has recovered from a nagging financial hangover that was exacerbated by the biggest acquisition in its 69-year history -- the $ 19 billion purchase of compaq computer , completed in 2002 over strident shareholder objections .
hewlett-packard 's purchase of electronic data systems could mean tougher competition for ibm and its 10,500 triangle employees .
hp estimates that the deal , when completed , will give it about 7 percent of the technology services market , compared with ibm 's 10 percent share .
that means that if things go well long term , hp could catch big blue in the business of providing technology services such as data management , information technology outsourcing and consulting , said morningstar equity analyst rick hanna .
" while ibm is a clear no. 1 now ... hp-eds is a real player and potentially a long-term threat , " hanna said .
in the short term , ibm has little to worry about , hanna said , given its clear leadership in technology services , which accounts for about 60 percent of its revenue .
now hp will try to show that it learned from its mistakes by making the second-largest deal in its history pay off more quickly .
investors are worried that hp is taking an unnecessary risk on eds , whose disappointing profit margins had caused its stock to drop by about 30 percent in the past year .
hp shares sagged $ 2.56 tuesday to finish at $ 44.27 .
" it appears to be a very daunting deal , " said american technology research analyst shaw wu .
the $ 25-per-share sale price represents a nice payoff for eds stockholders , who will receive a nearly 33 percent premium compared with the company 's share price before news of the hp talks leaked out monday .
eds shares added 26 cents to close at $ 24.34 tuesday .
including eds ' net debt , hp values the acquisition at $ 13.9 billion .
based on eds ' nearly 530 million common shares , restricted stock units and options , the sales prices works out to $ 13.2 billion .
that represents about one-fourth of the $ 50 billion increase in hp 's market value since hurd joined the company .
hp prizes eds because it wants to become a much bigger competitor in technology services -- a wide-ranging category that includes running computer data centers , stitching together software programs and consulting on special projects for business and government clients .
