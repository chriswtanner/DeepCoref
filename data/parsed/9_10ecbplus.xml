president barack obama overturns bush administration ruling on endangered species act .
wednesday , march 4 , 2009 , 10 : 53 am .
president barack obama announced plans tuesday to resume full scientific reviews of projects that might harm endangered wildlife and plants .
the president signed a memorandum putting on hold a bush administration regulation allowing agencies to avoid scientific reviews in endangered species decisions .
during a visit to the interior department , obama said the review process had been undermined by past administrations .
"for more than three decades , the endangered species act has successfully protected our nation's most threatened wildlife .
we should be looking for ways to improve it , not weaken it , " obama said .
obama's action puts the bush regulation on hold until the interior and commerce departments complete a review .
while on the campaign trail , obama said he would fight to maintain the protections of the endangered species act and work to undo what was then a proposal by the bush administration .
the rule , finalized in december , made optional the mandatory , independent consultations federal scientists have performed for 35 years on projects .
the reviews have been blamed by developers and federal agencies for delays and cost increases .
instead , the bush rule allowed federal agencies to decide for themselves whether projects such as dams and power plants posed risks to endangered species or the places they live .
these changes , which were completed in a relatively short time , were described at the time by the bush administration as minor .
but democrats and environmentalists have argued that the regulations overhauled long - standing policy .
democratic leaders in congress who have been attempting to reverse the rule applauded the president's decision .
"i wholeheartedly support the president's proposal to restore the protections for endangered species that the bush administration spent so many years trying to undermine , " said rep . nick rahall , d - w . va . , who chairs the house natural resources committee .
rahall is pushing to overturn the rule through a congressional resolution .
there is also a provision tucked into the $410 billion spending bill the house passed last week that would allow the interior and commerce secretaries to withdraw regulations .
since the rule took effect before obama was sworn in , overturning it through regulation would require a lengthy review process .
industry and business representatives said restoring scientific input would only delay projects , including those that will be funded by the recently passed stimulus package .
but obama , in announcing his decision , said that economic recovery and protecting the environment are not at odds with one another .
"we can grow our economy today , " obama said , "and preserve the environment for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren . " .
