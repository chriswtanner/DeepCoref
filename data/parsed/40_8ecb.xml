the only hardware release at macworld expo 2009 was a predictable unibody upgrade for the 17-inch macbook pro , which apple reports will have an eight-hour battery life .
eight hours is surely impressive for such a large , powerful notebook .
but this news is nonetheless underwhelming for several reasons .
some thought apple was strategically waiting so it could ship the 17-inch macbook pro with a low-cost , quad-core processor .
intel released such a chip just recently , and apc suspected this cpu would appear in apple 's top-of-the-line notebook .
but much to our disappointment , the 17-incher is shipping with a plain ol ' dual-core ( core 2 duo ) chip .
true , at 2.66 ghz it 's slightly faster than the other macbook pros .
but there are hardly any substantial changes to justify the longer wait for this notebook .
apple was able to beef up the macbook pro 's battery by taking advantage of the generous amount of space available in the notebook 's enclosure .
this battery is also non-removable , which apple said was necessary to use as much space as possible .
apple also claims the new macbook pro 's battery is more environmentally friendly because it lasts five years and has fewer toxins .
looks like our apple source , and several others in various blogs , were incorrect about the rumor of a new mac mini launching at macworld .
we 'll look into the reasons why and provide an update soon .
