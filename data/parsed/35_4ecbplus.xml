charger jamal williams arrested on suspicion of dui .
february 5 , 2009 .
for the second time in less than a month , a member of the san diego chargers has been arrested on suspicion of drunk driving .
according to the california highway patrol , defensive tackle jamal williams was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving last weekend on a freeway outside downtown .
williams , who was booked into county jail and later released on bail , did give a blood sample for a blood - alcohol test .
however the results have not yet been divulged .
just last month , wide receiver vincent jackson , who was on probation for a previous dui arrest , was pulled over for investigation of dui .
that arrest was just five days prior to the team's second - round playoff loss at pittsburgh .
in a statement released by the team , general manager a . j . smith noted , "it's disappointing to hear about the issue involving jamal williams .
we'll continue to monitor the situation and let the legal process run its course .
the chargers have always been leaders and positive contributors to our community .
we take our stature in the community very seriously . " .
while everyone is human , this appears to be yet another case of a professional athlete not using the matter that is provided to all of us between our ears .
with more and more professional athletes making news these days , and oftentimes not for the right reasons , it is no wonder many people have trouble relating with the pros .
salaries that the common man generally doesn't see and an attitude of not caring in many cases is just part of the problem .
while williams and jackson are presumed innocent , hopefully both of them learn a lesson .
at the end of the day , their alleged actions not only impact them , but that family of four , the couple out on a date , or the guy returning home from his work shift .
when you get behind the wheel of your car drunk , you could ruin more than just your life .
