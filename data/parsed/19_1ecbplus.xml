brooklyn neighborhood is 'a powder keg' after teen killed by police .
mar . 14 , 2013 , 8 : 12 pm .
hostility has been mounting this week in east flatbush , brooklyn , after two plainclothes police officers fatally shot 16 - year - old kimani gray after he allegedly pointed a revolver at them on saturday night .
on monday a group of about 130 people were marching toward the 67th police precinct station when about two dozen young protesters splintered off -- drawing riot police -- and trashed a rite aid .
tuesday the crowd was mostly calm , but on wednesday -- the same day gray's autopsy showed he had been shot seven times -- part of the 200 person crowd became unruly .
the night began with hope that gray's mother would speak at a vigil alongside mothers of local shooting victims , but the night turned when about 30 young men showed up in the shadows across the street .
"they were staying in the dark area of the street , " a witness told cnn .
"you just knew it was going to turn into the cops trying to contain those kids who were obviously gonna go for it .
that just stopped the original intention of the night . " .
the witness said the teenagers suddenly took off , fanning through streets and side streets , followed by the sound of glass breaking and metal store - front gates being pulled down .
protesters began throwing bricks and bottles while cops began pepper - spraying and arresting .
by the end an officer's face and the window of a police van had been hit with bricks , and 46 people had been arrested .
the string of incidents has amplified the distrustful friction between the neighborhood's informal crews of armed teenagers and its aggressive police , whom residents say make prejudiced decisions based on race .
kenneth j . montgomery , an attorney for the gray family , told the la times that the police "patrol these neighborhoods like they " re paramilitary . " .
" [ the police ] have a hard time because there " s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , " a local barber told the new york times .
" but when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . " .
police say that on saturday around 11 : 30 p . m . kimani gray was standing outside his home with five other young men before splitting off when he noticed two plainclothes officers in an unmarked car .
after he "adjusted his waistband and continued to act in a suspicious manner , " officials say the cops got out of their car and approached gray -- who allegedly turned toward them with a loaded . 38 - caliber revolver in hand .
the 30 - year - old sergeant and 26 - year - old fired 11 shots -- the autopsy showed that seven bullets entered gray's body , three of them from the rear .
a revolver loaded with four bullets was reportedly recovered from the scene .
police commissioner raymond kelly told the new york times there was " nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines " while john c . cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the police department , said "it appears to be a good shooting " under the reported circumstances .
that statement doesn't pacify neighborhood residents , who question the official story -- some in the community don't believe gray had a gun -- and perceive the officers' behavior as part of a larger trend of nypd antagonism .
" we " re talking about a powder keg out here .
any incident could trigger it , " city councilman charles barron told the la times .
on wednesday tensions "seemed to be decreasing until mahnefah gray , sister of the teen killed by police , was arrested while crossing the street , " according to danny gold of metropolis .
