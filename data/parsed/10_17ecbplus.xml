herald : sox make offer to teixeira ( 8 years ? ) .
michael silverman reports that the red sox .
have made an offer [ for mark teixeira ] , the biggest and longest yet for this current ownership group .
the offer is believed to be for at least eight years . . .
teixeira is believed to be seeking an average annual value of more than the $21 million that left - hander cc sabathia is close to finalizing with the new york yankees for the next seven years , and a lot closer to the $27 . 5 million that third baseman alex rodriguez is guaranteed to make through 2017 with the yankees . . . .
there is every indication that the red sox view teixiera in the same "must - have" light as they did matsuzaka .
mlb's ian browne notes the sticky situation that would arise with only two infield positions for teixeira , mike lowell and kevin youkilis .
