the civilian death toll in gaza increased dramatically today , with reports of more than 40 palestinians killed after missiles exploded outside a un school where hundreds of people were sheltering from the continuing israeli offensive .
two israeli tank shells struck the school in jabaliya refugee camp , spraying shrapnel on people inside and outside the building , according to news agency reports .
the medical director of the hospital in jabaliya told the guardian 41 bodies had been brought in so far and more could be on the way .
reuters journalists filmed bodies scattered on the ground amid pools of blood and torn shoes and clothes .
in addition to the dead , several dozen people were wounded , hospital officials said .
the israeli military said it was looking into the reports .
a united nations official in gaza said the school was clearly marked with a un flag and its location had been reported to israeli authorities .
john ging , director of operations in gaza for unrwa , the united nations relief and works agency , said that three artillery shells landed at the perimeter of the school where 350 people were taking shelter .
" of course it was entirely inevitable if artillery shells landed in that area there would be a high number of casualties , " he said .
asked whether there were hamas militants in the area at the time of the attack , ging said it was the scene of clashes " so there 's an intense military and militant activity in that area . " .
he said un staff vetted palestinians seeking shelter at their facilities to make sure militants were not taking advantage of them. " so far we 've not had violations by militants of our facilities , " he said .
ging called for an independent investigation of the strikes near un facilities .
" i saw a lot of women and children wheeled in , " fares ghanem , a hospital official told the associated press .
" a lot of the wounded were missing limbs and a lot of the dead were in pieces . " .
majed hamdan , an ap photographer , who rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks , said many children were among the dead .
" i saw women and men parents slapping their faces in grief , screaming , some of them collapsed to the floor .
they knew their children were dead , " he said .
" in the morgue , most of the killed appeared to be children .
in the hospital , there was n't enough space for the wounded . " .
elsewehere , at least 12 members of an extended family , including seven young children , were killed in an air strike on their house in gaza city .
the bodies of the daya family were pulled from the rubble of a house in gaza city 's zeitoun district after it was hit by two israeli missiles .
the dead included seven children aged from one to 12 years , three women and two men .
nine other people were believed to be trapped in the rubble .
hours earlier , three young men - all cousins - died when the israelis bombed another un school , the asma primary school in gaza city .
they were among about 400 people who sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in beit lahiya in northern gaza .
the un , which said the school in jabaliya was clearly marked , said it was " strongly protesting these killings to the israeli authorities and is calling for an immediate and impartial investigation " .
" where it is found that international humanitarian law has been violated , those responsible must be held to account .
under international law , installations such as schools , health centres and un facilities should be protected from attack .
well before the current fighting , the un had given to the israeli authorities the gps co-ordinates of all its installations in gaza , including asma elementary school . " .
the killings take the total toll in palestinian lives since the israelis launched their assault on the gaza strip 11 days ago to above 600 .
doctors at gaza hospitals say that at least one-fifth of the victims are children and a large number of women are among the dead .
israel continues to insist that the bulk of those killed are hamas and islamic jihad fighters , although its claim to be going to extraordinary lengths to target only " terrorists " has been undermined by one of its own tanks firing on a building being used by israeli troops , killing four .
the sharp spike in the number of civilian casualties came as israeli troops and tanks moved into gaza 's second largest city , khan younis , for the first time today , supported by intensive artillery strikes as the military pledged to press on with its attack .
in a separate attack earlier in the day , three palestinians were killed in an air strike on another school run by unwra , the un relief agency .
nine israelis , including three civilians hit by rocket fire , have been killed in the conflict .
at least five rockets fired from gaza landed in israel today , including one that hit the town of gadera , 17 miles from tel aviv , police said .
a three-year-old girl was wounded .
the heaviest fighting has been in northern gaza , with witnesses reporting wave after wave of bombing strikes across the north of the territory accompanied by gunfire from helicopters and artillery from land and sea .
thousands of palestinians have been ordered to leave their homes or forced to flee the fighting .
in shajaiyeh , east of gaza city , israeli troops seized control of three apartment blocks and set up gun positions on the rooftops .
residents were locked in their homes and soldiers confiscated their mobile phones , neighbours said .
three of the four israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire died when a tank mistakenly fired on a building where the soldiers had taken up positions .
there was heavy artillery fire to cover the evacuation of 24 soldiers who were injured , including the commander of the golani infantry brigade , one of israel 's key fighting forces .
israel 's defence minister , ehud barak , said his country 's troops would continue their operation despite mounting palestinian casualties and growing international calls for a ceasefire .
" hamas has so far sustained a very heavy blow from us , but we have yet to achieve our objective , and therefore the operation continues , " barak said .
the israeli foreign minister , tzipi livni , said the offensive was intended to change permanently the shape of israel 's conflict with hamas .
" when israel is targeted , israel is going to retaliate , " she said .
israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire .
the military said it had bombed more smuggling tunnels across the border with egypt , in the south , and hit more than 40 other sites across gaza including buildings storing weapons and rocket launching areas .
in gaza , mahmoud zahar , the most senior leader of hamas in the strip and a hardliner in the movement , appeared on the party 's al-aqsa television station and gave a defiant speech threatening attacks not only in gaza but elsewhere .
" the zionists have legitimised the killing of their children by killing our children .
they have legitimised the killing of their people all over the world by killing our people , " zahar said .
he urged hamas fighters to " crush your enemy " .
another hamas figure , a recognised military spokesman called abu ubaida , said thousands of hamas fighters were waiting in gaza to take on the israeli military , and that rocket attacks would increase .
more than 40 were fired into southern israel yesterday , including one that landed in an empty kindergarten , which , like all schools near the gaza border , has been closed since the conflict began .
israeli police said a total of 520 rockets had been fired in the past 11 days of fighting .
israeli troops are now deployed in and around the major urban areas of gaza , particularly to the north , in beit hanoun , beit lahiya and jabaliya .
using leaflets , telephone calls and radio announcements , they have ordered residents in many areas to leave their homes , forcing at least 15,000 palestinians to flee to safety elsewhere .
at least 5,000 are staying in 11 different un schools and shelters .
the un said more than 1 million gazans were still without electricity or water and that it was increasingly difficult for staff to distribute aid or reach the injured .
it said more industrial diesel was needed to reopen the strip 's sole power plant , which has been shut for a week .
ten transformers have been damaged in the fighting .
more wheat grain is needed for food handouts , and the un said karni , the main commercial crossing , should be reopened to allow it in .
four ambulances and three mobile clinics were destroyed when bombs hit the headquarters of the union of health care committees in gaza city .
john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , said gaza represented an " increasingly alarming " humanitarian crisis , and that the territory was running low on clean water , power , food , medicine and other supplies since israel began its offensive .
israeli leaders claim there is no humanitarian crisis .
