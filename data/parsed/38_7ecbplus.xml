march 14 , 2013 - united states - .
a 4 . 6 - magnitude earthquake rattled northern california overnight thursday , shaking residents from san francisco to north of sacramento .
the temblor struck at 2 : 09 a . m . and was centered in geyserville , about 20 miles north of santa rosa , according to the u . s . geological survey .
usgs measurements indicated at least 20 smaller earthquakes followed throughout the morning .
the santa rosa press democrat reported the quake began only one mile below ground level , which is why it was felt across the region .
there were no immediate reports of damage , the newspaper said .
but it woke people up .
more than 60 people reported to usgs's "did you feel it ? " site , with reports ranging from san francisco and oakland to lake and yuba counties .
others reported the shaking on twitter .
tectonic summary - maacama fault .
the maacama fault is mostly a right - lateral strike - slip fault that lies north of santa rosa and the immediate san francisco bay area and extends as far north as ukiah .
it connects to the rodgers creek fault through a complex set of faults between santa rosa and healdsburg , and is thought to be the northward continuation of the hayward - rodgers creek fault system .
the 2007 working group for california earthquake probability assigned a total slip rate on the maacama fault of approximately 9 mm / yr ( 1 / 3 inches / yr ) , based on the assumption that it continues the slip on the hayward - rodgers creek fault northward .
the central and northern sections of the fault have been observed to accommodate approximately 7 mm / yr ( 1 / 4 inch / year ) of creep along it .
the maacama fault parallels and overlaps the rodgers creek fault , in a geometry that is causing the ground between the faults to subside .
in sonoma county north of healdsburg , the maacama fault is largely obscured by massive landslides where it passes east of alexander valley .
the 2007 working group for california earthquake probability combined the maacama and the garberville faults into single a 181 - km ( 110 mile ) long fault and determined m7 . 5 as the maximum magnitude for this combined fault system .
there is very little known about the seismic history or earthquake cycle of the maacama fault , and as such recurrence intervals are uncertain .
