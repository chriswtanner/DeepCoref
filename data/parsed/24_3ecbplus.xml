thieves in $2 . 6 million smash - and - grab raid on paris jewelry store .
a smash - and - grab on a high end paris store saw four robbers make off with jewelry and watches valued at over $2 . 6 million early monday .
at around 4 : 30 a . m . local time ( 11 . 30 p . m . et ) the thieves rammed an suv into the front of the casty store , near the prestigious place vendome , a well - known square in the center of the french capital that is home to a number of jewelers and high - end stores .
after scooping up jewelry and watches estimated to be worth 2 million euros ( $2 . 6 million ) the thieves reversed their car out of the store and set fire to it before making off in another vehicle , le monde reported .
the raid comes little over a month after a masked bandit made off with an $136m worth of diamonds and jewels from the carlton intercontinental hotel in cannes on the glamorous french riviera , in possibly the world " s biggest heist .
a lone robber entered through a french door at the side of the building on the famed la croisette seafront , scooped up the loot and then jumped out of another window .
despite a huge police investigation , the audacious culprit remains at large .
thieves also targeted the annual cannes film festival , stealing almost $2 million of jewelry from the safe in the hotel room of an american jeweler working for chopard , one of switzerland " s most famous diamond merchants .
days later a $2 . 5 million necklace was lifted by a crook at a movie industry party at the even more exclusive resort of cap d " antibes , near the italian border .
