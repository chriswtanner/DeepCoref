a judge on saturday sentenced the man who killed four people during a brazen courthouse escape to multiple life sentences with no chance of parole , and to hundreds more years on more than 50 charges .
the man , brian g. nichols , 37 , was found guilty last month of murder and dozens of other counts in the march 2005 rampage that led from a downtown courthouse to an atlanta neighborhood and which ended with his capture the next day in a suburban county .
judge james g. bodiford of superior court handed down the maximum sentence on each charge , to run consecutively .
" if there was any more i could give you , i would , " judge bodiford said .
mr. nichols was spared multiple death sentences when the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision , as required by georgia law , recommending that punishment .
the sentence ends more than three years of efforts to bring mr. nichols to justice since his arrest , frustrating victims ' relatives and angering state legislators over the costs .
mr. nichols escaped on march 11 , 2005 , as he was being escorted to a trial for rape .
he beat a deputy guarding him and stole her gun .
he burst into the courtroom and shot and killed judge rowland barnes ; a court reporter , julie ann brandau ; and sgt. hoyt teasley , a fulton county sheriff 's deputy .
mr. nichols fled downtown atlanta and managed to evade hundreds of police officers overnight .
in the buckhead neighborhood of atlanta , he shot and killed a federal immigration and customs agent , david wilhelm , at a house the agent was renovating .
mr. nichols was captured the next day in suburban gwinnett county after a woman he took hostage , ashley smith robinson , alerted the police .
ms. smith robinson was credited with bringing a peaceful ending to the rampage by appealing to mr. nichols 's religious beliefs and giving him illegal drugs .
mr. nichols , who was raised in baltimore , confessed to the killings but said that he was legally insane and that he believed he was a slave rebelling against his masters .
prosecutors argued that he concocted the delusions to avoid the death penalty .
mr. nichols 's rampage led lawyers and judges to question their safety , and officials around the state re-examined courthouse security measures .
