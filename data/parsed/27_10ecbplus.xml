microsoft launches emergency patch for internet explorer .
microsoft has just released a new security update for internet explorer in order to patch a flaw affecting all versions of the company " s in - house browser , including ie11 on windows 8 . 1 rtm .
while microsoft claims that it has received reports of attacks aimed at internet explorer 8 and 9 , it appears that the security flaw affects all the other versions of the browser .
according to the company , the issue would allow remote code execution , which means that an attacker could get access to an unpatched system by directing users to a compromised website .
" this issue could allow remote code execution if an affected system browses to a website containing malicious content directed towards the specific browser type .
this would typically occur when an attacker compromises the security of trusted websites regularly frequented , or convinces someone to click on a link in an email or instant message , " the company explained .
the fix it tool released by microsoft can be used for ie6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 on windows xp , vista , 7 , 8 , and 8 . 1 , both preview and rtm . 32 - and 64 - bit versions of the operating systems are all included in the security advisory .
in addition , the tech giant recommends users to set internet and local intranet security zone settings to " high " in order to block activex controls and active scripting in these zones .
" this will help prevent exploitation but may affect usability ; therefore , trusted sites should be added to the internet explorer trusted sites zone to minimize disruption , " microsoft said .
at the same time , the softies suggest that it would be a good idea to configure internet explorer to prompt before running active scripting or to disable active scripting completely in the internet and local intranet security zones , just to be sure that everyone is on the safe side and no successful attacks are possible .
