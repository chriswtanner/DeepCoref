bettie page , the pin-up model whose seductive photographs in magazines titillated and outraged americans in the 1950s , has died , her agent said .
she was 85 .
" with deep personal sadness i must announce that my dear friend and client bettie page passed away at 6:41pm pst this evening ( 0241 gmt friday ) in a los angeles hospital , " her agent mark roesler said thursday in a statement .
page suffered a heart attack nine days earlier and never regained consciousness .
" she captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality , " roesler said .
page , with shoulder-length jet-black hair and bangs , combined sweetness and sexuality in a series of now-legendary posters and photographs in the 1950s , including as one of the inaugural centerfolds in hugh heffner 's new magazine playboy , which named her " the model of the century . " .
the nice-naughty image -- a sweet and beguiling smile matched with a curvacious figure and page 's propensity for burlesque films and bondage images -- proved highly combustible on the eve of america 's sexual revolution .
in the late 1950s page became one of the most photographed women in the world , and her popularity soared even as she left the limelight nearly half a century ago .
page later said she was puzzled by her effect on pop culture .
" i have no idea why i 'm the only model who has had so much fame so long after quitting work , " she told the los angeles times in 2006 .
in her old age , she refused to be photographed , preserving her mythic status .
" i want to be remembered , as i was when i was young and in my golden times ... .
i want to be remembered as the woman who changed people 's perspectives concerning nudity in its natural form . " .
born in 1923 in nashville , tennessee , bettie mae page was one of six children from an impoverished family .
after earning her university degree , she worked as a secretary and aspired to hollywood stardom but never made it as an actress .
a screen test at 20th century fox went badly , with a producer offering her a break in return for sexual favors -- she refused .
filmmaker and aviator howard hughes also doggedly pursued page but she rebuffed him as well .
" i never returned any of his calls , " she once said .
" i guess people will say i made a mistake .
but sex is part of love , and you should n't go around doing it unless you are in love .
i certainly did n't . " .
she posed for her first pin-up photos in 1947 and by the 1950s provocative pictures of her in bikinis or sexy lingerie were wildly popular , tacked up on the walls of locker rooms , student halls , offices and military barracks .
although the pictures -- which sometimes played on bondage themes -- seem tame by contemporary standards , they raised alarms in a more conservative era , prompting us senators to investigate pornography .
page was subpoenaed to appear before a senate committee headed by prominent democrat estes kefauver but in the end never had to testify .
for page , the bondage photos were harmless fun .
" but honestly , who could take any of this seriously ? " she said years later , according to her official website .
" i never understood how anyone believed those poses were sexy .
to be tied up ?
i do n't get it . " .
by 1958 , at the peak of her fame , page vanished from public view and her modeling days ended .
she became a born-again christian but struggled with marital problems and suffered from depression and violent mood swings .
in 1992 , she left a california mental hospital having been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic .
in the 1990s , a lawyer who later became her agent , mark roesler , used page 's famous images for a lucrative licensing and merchandising deal that helped her financially and renewed her fame .
the merchandise , including a clothing line , along with a film in 2005, .
" the notorious bettie page , " helped introduce her to a new generation in the united states and abroad .
" she was reclusive and private , so without intending to be , without quite understanding how , her modeling work made her a pivotal figure in the sexual revolution that began in the 1950s , " roesler said .
