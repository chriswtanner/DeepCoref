chiefs lose 20 - 13 to a fourth quarter indianapolis colt stampede .
sunday 23 dec 2012 .
the kansas city chiefs lost possibly the best game they " ve played this season .
they lost to a fourth quarter colt stampede 20 - 13 .
this time it was coach romeo crennel " s fault .
there they were on the colts 27 - yard line with inches to go for a first down and crennel decides to go for it .
he should have played it safe with a field goal .
they blew it on a quarterback sneak .
the score was tied 13 - 13 .
they handed the ball over to the colts at the 27 - yard line and the colts took it back down the field for a fourth quarter touchdown and won the game .
this was a game that saw a great performance by their running backs jamaal charles and former razorback peyton hillis .
charles turned in a 86 - yard touchdown run and rushed for a total of 226 yards and hillis rushed for more than a hundred yards .
put it all together and the chiefs gained 507 yards and still managed -- through penalties , interceptions and fumbles -- to lose the game .
astounding !
this gave the colts a 9 - 5 season and eligibility for the playoffs .
i guess it " s possible to put together a team that so consistently shoots itself in the foot , but the chiefs are an incredible collection of screwups with a few brilliant players who come out every week and make it look like it might be a football team .
but are usually thwarted by the goofups ; some must come off that field shaking their heads and fondering in frustration .
this is the chiefs " last home game of the season , and it would have been nice if they could have won it .
oh well , next week they journey to denver to take on the broncos in their mile high city with their rarified air .
denver is not going to be a pushover .
the broncos are 12 - 3 for the season after defeating the cleveland browns 34 - 12 sunday .
denver is up for the number one seed and the chiefs down in the basement with a 2 - 13 season .
hope springs eternal . . . .
