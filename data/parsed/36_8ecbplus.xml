the strange legal trip of polygamist warren jeffs .
saturday , june 12 , 2010 .
five years ago , warren jeffs was charged with sex crimes resulting from the polygamous marriages he arranged for his followers in the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints ( flds ) .
jeffs then began a circular journey through the jailhouses and courtrooms of the west .
this week , the self - styled prophet awoke to the promise of a change of scenery - but not a change of fortune .
an arizona judge dismissed the original charges against jeffs , the very charges that had catapulted him into national headlines .
but the dismissal has only cleared the way for texas authorities to get their hands on him to face even more serious charges .
"extradition proceedings against warren jeffs have commenced , " lauri saathoff , a spokesperson for texas attorney general greg abbott told time .
jeffs has already spent more time in an arizona county jail cell than he would have spent in prison if found guilty of the original charges : arranging and performing marriages between two underage girls and their older male relatives , thus being an accomplice to sexual misconduct with minors .
the prosecutor in the case said the two victims no longer wanted to pursue the charges , making a prosecution impractical .
jeffs' attorney , mike picarretta , hinted at "irregularities" and said the cases would have been dropped years ago had they involved someone less well - known than his client .
but he doesn't face imminent release .
arizona had put its charges on hold while jeffs was prosecuted in utah on similar charges .
in september 2007 a utah jury found him guilty of two counts of being an accomplice to rape by performing a marriage involving an underage girl .
he was given two five - years - to - life terms , moved to utah state prison and then back to arizona to await trial on the charges in that state .
now texas wants him .
state officials are not revealing when jeffs , 54 , will be moved , but mohave county sheriff tom sheahan is under arizona court orders to act speedily .
the sheriff says he hopes jeffs will be out of his jail by this week's end .
"he's been a problem inmate since we had him , " sheahan told the san angelo ( texas ) standard - times .
"mr . jeffs was a handful from day one with his self - inflicted hunger strikes . " .
jeffs served as president and prophet of the fundamentalist church of the jesus christ of the latter day saints after his father , rulon jeffs , died in 2002 .
in june 2005 , days after being indicted in arizona on the charges of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor , jeffs fled the colorado city , arizona , area , home to a large flds community .
a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was placed on the fbi's 10 most wanted list .
fourteen months later , he was arrested outside las vegas , nevada , and began his journey from court to court and jail to jail .
jeffs' defenders claim he is a victim of religious persecution .
he has spent much of his time in jail talking about his faith , fasting and praying .
tall , slender , with a wide - eyed gaze that seems to compel allegiance among his flds followers , jeffs is a calm presence in court , but his life behind bars has been more tumultuous .
ill from fasting , his knees bleeding and sore from prolonged prayer sessions , he has been hospitalized and force - fed several times .
he has also been inconsistently penitent .
"i am one of the most wicked men on the face of the earth since the days of father adam , " jeffs can be heard saying on a tape recorded by authorities at the purgatory jail in st . george , utah .
still , jeffs' attorneys are pledging to fight extradition and also have an appeal of the utah case pending before the state supreme court .
they also may seek a new trial based on recently uncovered evidence - now under investigation by the utah attorney general's office - that some medical records in the trial may not have been original documents , but reconstructed ones .
jeffs' legal team says the utah case must be resolved before their client is moved to texas .
the ordeal also has been difficult for his alleged victims , says roger hoole , an attorney for elissa wall and susie barlow , former flds members and child brides .
"they have been reviled .
they are hated and they have been scapegoated" in the flds community , hoole told time .
the flds communities in northern arizona and southern utah have strong , deep roots to the region going back to the mid - 19th century .
many families bear the same name - evidence of generations of intermarriage - and former flds members say communal wealth is used by the leadership to maintain power and punish .
witnesses have refused to testify in the cases against jeffs .
texas prosecutors have sidestepped that problem by using genetic evidence and extensive church documents seized during an april , 2008 raid at the flds yearning for zion ranch in west texas .
jeffs was indicted in july , 2008 , by a schleicher county grand jury in eldorado , texas , home to the yfz ranch .
the state authorities removed more than 400 children from the ranch , plus boxes of evidence , some of which purport to show jeffs kissing child brides .
he is facing charges of aggravated sexual assault , sexual assault and bigamy charges which could result in at least one life sentence .
if extradited , he will join 12 other flds defendants charged with similar offenses .
in a steady march beginning last october , five flds members have been convicted of felonies and received sentences ranging from seven to 75 years .
a sixth trial is just getting under way in the small eldorado courthouse and six more men await trail - seven if jeffs finds himself in a west texas jail .
