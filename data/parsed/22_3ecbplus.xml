the woman who allegedly shot three co - workers -- killing two-- at the kraft plant thursday night has been charged with murder , attempted murder , aggravated assault , burglary , and other related charges , says philadelphia district attorney seth williams .
the victims and alleged shooter in the last night " s kraft plant shooting had a history of arguing that dates back several years -- the suspect thought her co - workers were spraying chemicals on her and talking behind her back , according to police .
yvonne hiller , 43 , got into an altercation with the two women and a male co - worker thursday night , was taken to the supervisor " s office , suspended and escorted out of the building . .
ten minutes after being taken off the job , hiller drove her car to the security gate and forced her way in at gunpoint , police say , and headed back up to the third floor armed with her . 357 magnum , which she has a permit to carry .
she went to the employee lounge , saw four of her co - workers -- three of with whom she " d just had the altercation .
the fourth person told her to get out of the lounge .
she shot the other three , police say .
bryant dalton , 39 , was shot in the neck and is hospitalized in critical condition .
latonya brown , 36 , was shot in the head and tanya wilson , 47 , was shot in the side .
both women died .
kenneth dorsey says the woman accused of killing two co - workers and critically injuring a third at the kraft plant in northeast philly is a good person .
and so were the two women she " s accused of gunning down with a . 357 magnum , just minutes after she " d been suspended and escorted from the building .
" we talked about her muslim faith and i wished her happy ramadan , " dorsey said .
" i never thought in my deepest heart that it would come down to this , " dorsey said .
the reason hiller was suspended had not been made public friday afternoon and while some co - workers said she had a history of run - ins with other workers and management , dorsey said like anyone , they sometimes had their differences , but always got along .
