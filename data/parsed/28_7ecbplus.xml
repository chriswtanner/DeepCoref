fred larue , a high - ranking nixon administration official who served a prison term for his role in watergate and was among those rumored to be deep throat , has died .
he was 75 .
his body was discovered tuesday by a maid who entered his hotel room in biloxi , coroner gary hargrove said .
the coroner said he believes larue died saturday of natural causes .
larue was known as the "bagman" who delivered payoffs to keep participants in the watergate break - in quiet , and served 4ï¿½ months in federal prison for conspiracy to obstruct justice .
larue served as special assistant to john mitchell , the former attorney general who later headed president nixon's committee to re - elect the president .
larue was present at a 1972 meeting with mitchell and nixon aide jeb stuart magruder at nixon's vacation home in key biscayne , fla . , where the plan to break in democratic headquarters at the watergate complex in washington allegedly was hatched .
larue said he advised against the burglary .
deep throat connection ?
larue discounted rumors that he was deep throat , saying the mysterious source for washington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein on the watergate story was probably a combination of several people .
woodward says deep throat was an individual and not a composite , and promised to reveal his identity only after the source is dead .
a request for comment from woodward left with the newspaper wednesday was not immediately returned .
among the other people who have been cited as possible deep throats are earl j . silbert , an original watergate prosecutor ; alexander haig , who was nixon's chief of staff and ronald reagan's secretary of state ; l . patrick gray , the acting fbi director who lived four blocks from woodward ; and deputy white house counsel fred fielding .
all have denied it .
after his political career ended in scandal , larue returned to his home state of mississippi to work in his family's oil company and with its real estate holdings .
in an interview last summer with the sun herald newspaper , larue said magruder lied when he claimed nixon knew about the break - in .
magruder claimed nixon approved the plan in a telephone conversation with mitchell .
phone call disputed .
larue believed no such conversation occurred , saying he screened all the telephone calls on the getaway to key biscayne .
"i'm exceedingly angry about it .
i don't recall any phone call .
i don't think there was one , " he said .
if the president had approved the plan , larue believes that mitchell would have told him .
"there's absolutely no way , because of my unique relationship with john and martha mitchell , that he would not have told me that when i was in key biscayne , " larue said .
"absolutely no way .
i had dinner with the mitchells four or five times a week .
it was not just a political relationship .
it was a very personal relationship . " .
