greek government under fire over handling of riots .
a week of violence in greece has taken its toll on the fragile conservative government , with opinion polls showing on sunday that many think authorities mishandled the worst rioting in decades .
the december 6 killing of a 15-year-old teenager by police unleashed a wave of unrest by thousands of students and anarchists across the country , feeding on growing anger over political scandals and the impact of a global recession on greece 's economy .
while the violence generally has subsided in the past few days , small groups of hooded youngsters with fire bombs are still rampaging at night in the capital , fighting running battles with riot police and smashing shops .
prime minister costas karamanlis has pledged to protect people and property , but he has drawn widespread criticism for not acting quickly and decisively to tackle the revolt .
an opinion poll published by ethnos newspaper on sunday said 83.3 percent of greeks were unhappy with the government 's response to the violence .
discontent was high -- at 65.6 percent -- even among supporters of karamanlis ' new democracy party , which has a one-seat majority in parliament and already lagged behind the socialist opposition before the riots .
another survey , in kathimerini daily , put disapproval of the government at 68 percent with 60 percent of those polled saying the riots were a social uprising rather than an outburst by an isolated fringe of violent protesters .
more demonstrations are planned for monday , including one outside the police headquarters in athens .
eight days of clashes have caused 200 million euros ( $ 265.3 million ) of damage in athens alone .
the city was calm on sunday but broken shop windows bore witness to the latest , sporadic riots overnight , when a few hundred youths wearing gas masks attacked a government building , four shops and two banks .
" i 'm tired of coming to the shop every night to check the damages .
you think it 's going to calm down and then it starts again , " said anna pavlidou , manager of a central athens mobile phone store that has been repeatedly attacked and looted .
" the government should assume its responsibilities and resign .
it did n't handle it well .
if it had , we would n't have 355 damaged shops in athens .
i mean , we will not be able to open until christmas , " she told reuters .
" someone has to understand the deeper reasons for this -- poverty , high unemployment -- and solve it radically . " .
the policeman charged with killing alexandros grigoropoulos has been jailed along with a colleague pending trial , while more than 400 protesters have been detained over the unrest .
in central athens , where even in calmer times barely a week goes by without a demonstration , riot police with teargas canisters have been manning street corners at night , especially in the leftist exarchia neighborhood where the boy was shot .
