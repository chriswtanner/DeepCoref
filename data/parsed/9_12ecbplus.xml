obama white house reverses bush rule on protection of endangered species .
• interior and commerce departments agree .
• government wildlife experts to be consulted on development .
tuesday 28 april 2009 22 . 34 bst .
the obama administration overturned one of the most controversial environmental measures of the george bush era today , striking down a rule that had weakened protection for endangered species .
officials at the interior and commerce ministries said they had returned to a requirement that government wildlife experts sign off on any new development - mining , logging or road construction - that could hurt animals , fish or plants that are at risk of going extinct .
today's move was the latest in a series of declarations by obama officials meant to chip away at the bush environmental legacy .
a number of those measures were put in place in the final hours of the bush administration , in what became known as "midnight regulations" .
until last december , developers had been required for more than two decades to get approval from government wildlife experts before embarking on new projects .
but the bush administration in its final days brought in a rule leaving it up to businesses to consult with government biologists on the impact of new development .
environmentalists had accused bush of effectively gutting protections for threatened or endangered species , and activists had sent more than 70 , 000 petitions to officials in the obama administration urging them to cancel the "midnight regulation" .
in a statement , the commerce secretary , gary locke , and the interior secretary , ken salazar , agreed .
after a scientific reviewed ordered by obama last month , they said they had reached the conclusion that such protections were indeed necessary .
"by rolling back this 11th hour regulation we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law , the two men said in a statement .
"federal agencies proposing to take actions that might affect threatened and endangered species will once again have to consult with biologists . " .
there was no word on another so - called midnight regulation that undermined protection for polar bear , an omission criticised by some activists today .
the move , which had been anticipated , comes just 24 hours after salazar took steps against another midnight regulation .
the interior secretary said he would ask the courts to overturn a last - minute rule that made it easier for coal mining operations engaged in mountaintop removal to dump dirt near streams .
