christopher simpson shoots pregnant girlfriend dead cause he didn't want another child to support .
an oklahoma jury has found 27 year old christopher simpson guilty of first degree murder of his then pregnant 20 year old girlfriend ka'loni flynn and their 12 week unborn child .
the murder came after flynn resisted simpson's demands to have an abortion and his reluctance with having to 'deal with another child to support . ' .
in finding christopher simpson guilty the jury recommended that he be sent to maximum life in prison without parole .
his sentencing is scheduled for november 8 .
prosecutors allege that simpson , who has at least one child from a past relationship , shot flynn twice in the head because he did not want another baby to support .
a dna expert testified that the 27 - year - old fathered the 12 - week - old fetus .
the murder is said to have taken place on april 9 at 3 am in flynn's car which was parked at the time .
it wasn't until in late june that authorities arrested christopher simpson believing that he was the chief instigator of her death .
told the deceased's father , herbert flynn jr : 'i'm glad it's over .
i'm glad we got the verdict we got .
she deserved it . ' .
during closing arguments , crawford county deputy prosecuting attorney jacob howell showed a photograph of flynn's body in the driver's seat of car , with bullet wounds to her temple and forehead .
prosecutors went on to acknowledge that the case against simpson was complicated and mostly circumstantial .
told howell : 'i hope we showed you this was investigated thoroughly , and that every possible suspect was investigated and excluded except one . ' .
simpson's attorney , warren gotcher , argued that no witnesses could place simpson at the crime scene and that his client was innocent .
prosecutor anthony evans countered by telling that simpson was trying to deflect blame because 'the defendant has the spotlight on him , and it's hot , and he needs to get it off him .
so what does he do ?
he pushes it over here .
desperate men do desperate things . ' .
according to a police affidavit , the couple had been dating for about three months when the 20 - year - old found out she was pregnant .
purportedly simpson became angry and expressed that he did not want to be a father again .
pushed to get an abortion , flynn declined telling christopher simpson that she did not believe in abortion .
of course the better question may have been if either one of the couple believed in using contraceptives and if not why ?
herbert flynn jr told 5news after simpson's arrest that on the night of his daughter's murder , she was planning to meet with her boyfriend to ask for help in applying for government assistance .
around the time of the shooting , simpson was late on child support payments for his 7 - year - old daughter , and according to a local sheriff , he had made statements to his friends that he did not want another child .
after flynn's death , a witness told police that simpson bragged to him that his girlfriend's killing will never be solved because it was 'too clean' and 'the perfect murder . ' .
the 20 - year - old woman , who aspired to be a nurse , allegedly told a friend a short time before the slaying that simpson had threatened to end the pregnancy for her if she refused to abort the baby .
