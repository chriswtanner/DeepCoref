the buy should also expand amd 's manufacturing capability , as well as integrate microprocessors and graphics engines in a single chip .
the acquisition is set to be wrapped up by year 's end .
advanced micro devices ( nyse : amd ) announced the largest acquisition in its history monday , paying about $ 5.4 billion to acquire graphics chip specialist ati technologies .
the acquisition will let amd expand its position in the commercial desktop and mobile computing markets , two areas where the company has not had much success .
in addition to accelerating the company 's x86 processor market share battle with intel ( nsdq : intc ) , the acquisition will expand amd 's access to manufacturing capacity and will lead to products that will integrate both microprocessors and graphics engines in a single chip in future releases .
the startup manages large-scale web infrastructures to prevent downtime related to configuration changes march madness 2008 was carried in full on the internet , on demand thanks to the technology innovations of cbs sports and cbs interactive gm 's tech leader talks about consolidating , re-engineering , upgrading the company 's application infrastructure .
" together we intend to create a processing powerhouse , " said hector ruiz , chairman and chief executive of amd , during a teleconference to announce the deal .
" we are confident the companies will integrate well together .
we believe that as technology advances , integration is not only inevitable , but also advantageous . " .
beginning next year , the companies will market " customer-centric platforms " using amd and ati technologies that will include all existing product offerings .
beginning in 2008 , amd plans to introduce platforms that integrate general purpose processors and graphics engines to meet specific media , data , and graphic requirements , says dave orton , president and chief executive of ati .
bob rivet , cfo of amd , says the acquisition is expected to be completed by year 's end .
the purchase is a combination of $ 4.2 billion in cash and 57 million shares of amd stock .
amd 's current area of greatest strength is providing processors that address the server and consumer desktop market , rivet says .
bringing ati 's graphics technology in-house will allow amd to better address the commercial desktop and laptop markets , he says , two areas where amd currently has a smaller presence .
while overall sales of x86 processors currently totals about $ 30 billion annually , amd is primarily addressing only a segment that totals about $ 13 billion , rivet says .
by expanding more into commercial desktop and laptop markets , amd will be able to grow its overall x86 market share .
rivet says that each percentage of market share gained equates to about $ 300 million in revenue .
ruiz says the acquisition " opens up a broad array of options for expanding our capacity infrastructure " by providing amd with an expanded relationship with some of the largest semiconductor foundries in the world .
currently amd utilizes internal manufacturing capacity , as well as capacity from chartered semiconductor manufacturing .
ati , however , has manufacturing relationships with two of the other largest foundries in the world , taiwan semiconductor manufacturing and united microelectronics .
the acquisition of ati by amd will now provide computer makers and customers with another choice for integrated microprocessor and graphics processor platforms , says bruce shaw , director of worldwide commercial marketing for amd .
currently only intel offers an integrated platform .
although amd will be providing integrated platforms , it will continue to support the use of third-party graphics products , such as those from nvidia , in combination with its processors , shaw says .
amd has no plans to reduce the ati product line or back away from markets it addresses , such as cell phones , where amd has little or no presence , he said .
ati is expected to continue to operate out of its headquarters in markham , ontario , and layoffs are expected to be minimal .
