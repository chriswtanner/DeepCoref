the connection between quarterback andrew luck and wide receiver reggie wayne has been vital to the colts " success this season .
it paid off one more time for the game - winning play in week 16 .
luck hit wayne for a seven - yard touchdown with just over four minutes to play to break a 13 - 13 tie and put the colts on the verge of a playoff berth .
the defense forced a three - and - out and rookie running back vick ballard ran for a first down to ice the game on the next colts possession .
give the colts defense a lot of credit for this one .
darius butler " s interception return opened the scoring for them and they stuffed chiefs quarterback brady quinn short on a fourth - and - inches play early in the fourth quarter .
the colts took the ball and went 73 yards in 13 plays to set up wayne " s game - winning score .
it had not been a great day for the colts offense to that point , but they were able to come up with the drive they needed to punch their postseason ticket .
while you " re giving the defense credit , though , make sure that you " re careful to note all the chances the defense gave kansas city as well .
jamaal charles had 226 yards on 22 carries , including an 86 - yard touchdown run , and peyton hillis ran for 101 yards .
given the lack of threat posed by quinn , it " s pretty damning that the colts couldn " t keep kansas city from running the ball .
that will likely be something for chuck pagano to worry about .
the head coach is expected to return to work on monday after months away from the team battling leukemia .
fixing the run defense before the playoffs will be hard , but it " s a good problem to have after drafting first overall last april .
