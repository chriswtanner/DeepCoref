amd's acquisition of seamicro puts intel on the defensive .
mar 2 , 2012 12 : 30 pm .
intel suffered a setback in the server market this week with the news that its former partner , seamicro , is being acquired by amd .
but the world's top chip maker said it was internally developing technology to remain competitive in the dense server market .
intel is developing integrated fabrics to boost i / o and high - performance networking and storage in servers , said jason waxman , general manager of intel's data center business unit , in an interview .
the technologies are being developed as the company tries to boost its presence in the market for dense servers used in cloud computing deployments in data centers .
amd is paying us$334 million for seamicro , which until now was in a tight partnership with intel to develop dense servers .
amd plans to sell seamicro - branded servers and license to customers its fabric technology , which virtualizes i / o and ties together storage and networking .
the deal is expected to close in march .
seamicro provides amd an instant presence in the nascent but fast - growing dense server market , and intel will now be playing catch - up , analysts said .
seamicro currently sells servers only with intel processors , and it is likely that amd will swap those with its own chips .
intel said it will continue to provide processors for seamicro servers , depending on the requirements .
amd's purchase of seamicro was an unexpected but smart move , said nathan brookwood , principal analyst at insight 64 .
the dense server market is growing as companies look to curb electricity costs by deploying low - power servers to respond to web and database queries .
but amd's prize in the acquisition is seamicro's specialized fabric , brookwood said .
seamicro's dense servers have many credit - card - sized motherboards that are connected by the fabric , which reduces the need for extra storage and network controllers .
it could take intel years to develop technology that is competitive with seamicro's fabric , brookwood said .
and intel will need to prove its technology is reliable before it is widely adopted .
"intel has all the pieces and all the technology and the smart people to put this together .
but it takes time , " brookwood said .
the seamicro deal gives amd a technological head start , but it will also intensify intel's focus on developing related technology , said dean mccarron , principal analyst at mercury research .
intel's waxman didn't specify how intel would build the fabric and i / o technology , but said the company would utilize assets from recently acquired networking companies .
in july it acquired fulcrum microsystems , which makes ethernet switches , and last month it purchased infiniband assets from qlogic , which provides high - performance fabric technology for servers .
intel also will remain competitive through new processors , memory and system management technologies .
but by the time intel's fabric technology matures , analysts said that amd could be far ahead in the integration of seamicro's technology inside chips .
amd in the future will allow implementation of third - party intellectual property inside chips , and by 2013 or 2014 , seamicro's ip could be inside opteron server chips .
currently seamicro's asic ( application - specific integrated circuit ) controlling the fabric is placed on the motherboard alongside the processor and memory .
when integrated inside a chip , it could be similar to calxeda's energycore chip , which will be used by hewlett - packard in its upcoming arm server .
the calxeda chip includes cache , an 80 - gigabit fabric switch and a management engine for power optimization .
amd will be able to license the fabric technology to work on arm processors , which could also put pressure on intel , analysts said .
arm processors are mainly found in smartphones and tablets , but there is growing interest in building power - efficient arm servers .
amd will be able to differentiate its offerings from intel's by offering seamicro technology with either arm or x86 processors as early as 2013 , said matt eastwood , group vice president for enterprise platform research at idc .
amd currently offers only x86 chips , but the company's chief technology officer , mark papermaster , has not ruled out implementing arm ip on its future chips .
but intel's waxman said the amd - seamicro deal does not change intel's dense server strategy , and the chip maker will continue to work with customers like dell and tyan .
"a part of our strategy is to provide a full portfolio of ingredients , " waxman said .
"we've got the right assets in our arsenal . " .
