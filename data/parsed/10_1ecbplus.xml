boston reportedly looks to ink free - agent slugger for eight years .
12 / 16 / 08 1 : 30 am est .
though the red sox continue to operate in intriguing secrecy when it comes to their pursuit of free - agent slugger mark teixeira , it appears an offer has been transmitted from the offices of 4 yawkey way in boston to the corporation of power agent scott boras in southern california .
the boston herald reported in its tuesday editions that the red sox have extended an offer for teixeira , believed to be the longest and richest in the seven - year history of the ownership group led by john w . henry .
though the newspaper doesn't cite its source , it stated that the offer is "believed to be for at least eight years . " .
the red sox have a club policy of not commenting on their negotiating stance with any free agents .
last week at the winter meetings , the washington nationals made teixeira an eight - year , $160 million offer .
angels general manager tony reagins recently confirmed that his club had also made an eight - year offer .
the orioles , according to reports , have offered teixeira a seven - year deal worth between $140 million and $150 million .
as for the red sox , gm theo epstein hasn't so much as uttered teixeira's name in any interviews with media members this offseason .
that has always been the way epstein conducts his business , and it's why you won't hear any public comments from the red sox regarding teixeira until he either signs with boston or goes somewhere else .
"we're being aggressive , really aggressive on players that we like , " epstein said last week .
the two biggest investments the red sox have made under current ownership ?
a $103 . 1 million sum - - including the $51 . 1 million posting fee - - to daisuke matsuzaka over six seasons and a five - year , $70 million contract for j . d . drew .
though breaking the bank in free agency isn't typically the way the red sox go about their hot stove business , they feel that teixeira - - who will turn 29 in april - - could be the centerpiece of their lineup for the better part of a decade .
the switch - hitter does everything the red sox like , from getting on base to hitting for power to playing terrific defense at first base .
epstein was asked at the winter meetings if the red sox could sign a marquee free agent this winter .
"i think there's a chance of it , " he said .
"there's definitely a chance that we don't .
i can't tell you which [ answer ] , eight , 10 , 12 years from now would have been better for the organization .
but players that we like and think can help us , we're going to try to sign to numbers that we think are reasonable and help us going forward and help us with our foundation .
if we get them , great .
if we don't , then we'll move on . " .
the yankees , boston's top rival , have already made a loud statement this winter , agreeing to terms with starters cc sabathia and a . j . burnett .
though epstein never likes to act as if he is counteracting the yankees , teixeira would clearly give boston's lineup a more dynamic look .
there have been conflicting reports as to whether the yankees have interest in teixeira .
when boras spoke at the winter meetings , he didn't sound as if he was in any rush to close the teixeira deal .
back in november , while attending a georgia tech football game , teixeira told espn that he'd like to sign by christmas .
if the red sox are successful in landing teixeira , it will create a somewhat sticky situation .
the red sox have kevin youkilis at first base and mike lowell at third .
to open a spot for teixeira , the red sox might have to trade lowell and move youkilis across the diamond .
however , lowell , coming off right hip surgery , is likely to have to prove his health in spring training if he is to be dealt .
last winter the red sox re - signed lowell , the most valuable player of the 2007 world series , to a three - year , $37 . 5 million contract .
the red sox control youkilis contractually for the next two years , so it's highly doubtful he would be moved .
youkilis finished third in the american league most valuable player voting in november .
david ortiz , boston's star designated hitter , is a 10 - 5 man ( 10 years in the majors , five with the same team ) , meaning he could veto any trade .
