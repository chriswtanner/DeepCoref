south sudan : "sudan bombed refugee camp" .
published on : 11 november 2011 - 11 : 25am .
a refugee camp in south sudan's unity state was bombed on thursday , south sudan officials and witnesses said , threatening to raise tensions with sudan .
sudan's armed forces denied they carried out the strike .
south sudan's president salva kiir talked of sudan's "pending invasion" of its neighbour .
violence along the poorly defined border since south sudan's independence in july has strained ties between the two nations .
they have accused one another of backing rebel groups on their sides of the border .
a reporter heard a large explosion in the yida refugee camp , then saw a crater about two metres wide , an unexploded bomb wedged in the side of a school building and a white aircraft flying north .
witnesses said there were three further explosions at 3 p . m .
yida is a camp of about 20 , 000 refugees from the nuba mountains region of south kordofan , a state north of the border where rebels have been fighting sudan's army since june .
the camp is less than 25 kilometres from the border with sudan .
there were no immediate reports of any casualties .
khartoum denies .
taban deng , the governor of unity state , accused khartoum of carrying out the attack .
"these people ( khartoum ) should be taken to book .
they should adhere to international laws and regulations , " deng told reporters in bentiu .
"the refugees need to be safe and need to be protected .
they ran away from war .
they should not be pursued inside the territory of south sudan , " he said .
al - sawarmi khalid , spokesman for sudan's armed forces , said sudan had not bombed anywhere in south sudan's territory .
"south sudan is a state in the united nations .
we respect international law , and it's impossible that we would do that , " he said .
south sudan split off into a separate country in july after voting overwhelmingly for secession in a january referendum , the culmination of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war between north and south .
fighting in blue nile state .
fire crackled in the dry grass around the crater about 100 metres away from an aid agency compound in yida camp .
"they ( khartoum ) don't want any life in the nuba mountains , and now they are expanding the war to the south sudan republic , " said yousif ismail , a refugee from the nuba mountains .
fighting has broken out in sudan's blue nile state this year .
blue nile and south kordofan are home to tens of thousands of fighters who sided with the south during the war but were left in sudan when south sudan seceded , analysts say .
khartoum's smoke screens .
last week , khartoum submitted its second complaint to the un security council , accusing south sudan of supplying anti - aircraft and anti - tank missiles , ammunition , landmines and mortars to the insurgents .
kiir denied those claims in a statement on thursday , calling them "smoke screens to mask khartoum's own activities in support of the armed dissident groups that are fighting its proxy war against the republic of south sudan" .
the accusations were being used to justify sudan's "pending invasion of the south , " kiir said .
the two countries have yet to agree on how much the new nation will pay to use sudan's oil pipelines and other facilities , which south sudan depends on to export crude .
they also dispute control of the abyei region .
some 2 million people died in the north - south civil war , waged for all but a few years since 1955 over religion , ideology , ethnicity and oil .
