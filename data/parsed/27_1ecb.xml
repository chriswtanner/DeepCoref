internet explorer issue 'fixed ' , say microsoft .
microsoft has said that an emergency security update has fixed a flaw in internet explorer that left millions of computers vulnerable to hacking and hijack .
the software patch , which was released last night , has closed a loophole that has seen the computers of at least two million users hacked by cyber criminals .
the problem related to a " zero day " flaw that tricked people into visiting an infected website , enabling hackers to gain access to online banking passwords and e-shopping logon details .
" microsoft has released a security update for internet explorer that will help protect its customers from malicious attacks , " said the company in a statement .
" like a vaccine developed to fight a virus , this 'security update ' will protect computers only if it is installed . " .
computers that are set to automatically update and install software will already be protected by the patch .
those users who manage their own updates are advised to download the fix as soon as possible from the microsoft website .
" when the patch is released , people should run , not walk , to get it installed , " said paul ferguson , a researcher with trend micro .
" this vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber criminals and getting worse every day . " .
it is thought that the security flaw , which came to light earlier this week , was exposed by accident , after a chinese security firm , knowsec , released details of the loophole believing microsoft had already issued a software fix to resolve it .
however , technology experts have warned that malware authors , who write the viruses and code that exploits security vulnerabilities , are already working on ways to get around the software update .
" we are seeing customised versions of the ie 7 exploit with varying degrees of obfuscation , " wrote mcafee security expert rahul mohandas on the company blog .
" malware authors have been coming up with innovative mechanisms to leverage this exploit to social engineer the not so tech-savvy internet users . " .
