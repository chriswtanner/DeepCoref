rim and t-mobile usa have finally gone official with the blackberry curve 8900 , just one day after the smartphone was seen in one of t-mo 's retail stores .
so now we know for sure that the new curve will be commercially available starting february , although an exact release date and a price were not given yet .
the 8900 is the thinnest blackberry ever built ( only 13.5 mm ) , and it 's also among the best looking smartphones to come form rim .
add wi-fi , gps , a 3.2mp autofocus camera and a nice 480 x 360 pixels display to that and you have a really cool handset .
the only thing that the curve 8900 is missing is 3g , but since t-mobile does n't have a nationwide 3g coverage yet , i guess this is not such a big problem .
while waiting for the new berry to be available , you can enter a t-mobile contest here , and maybe you 'll win one for free .
