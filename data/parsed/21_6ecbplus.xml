hit - and - run crash leaves queens mother of 2 dead .
on behalf of newman , anzalone & newman , llp . posted in hit and run accidents on friday , september 20 , 2013 .
in new york , there are laws about what to do if you have been involved in an accident .
one extremely important law is that both drivers must remain at the scene of the crash if someone was injured or killed .
this law helps make sure that no one is left behind to try to get help on their own .
unfortunately , some people are too afraid of the other potential consequences of a serious crash that they choose to flee the scene , leaving victims to fend for themselves .
this type of negligence can lead to a delay in treatment , which could result in death .
just last week , a serious hit - and - run accident took place in queens .
when a 59 - year - old woman stepped out of her car at 97th avenue and 117th street , she was struck by a car .
instead of stopping to help her , however , the driver fled the scene .
sadly , the mother of two died from injuries she sustained in the crash .
thankfully , a police officer was nearby and saw the collision .
he chased down the driver and eventually arrested him .
the driver was charged with drunk driving , leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death , and vehicular manslaughter .
for victims injured in a hit - and - run accident and the family members of those who were killed by hit - and - run drivers , the aftermath of such accidents can be very difficult to deal with .
on top of trying to recover from injuries or grieving the loss of a loved one , many people wonder how they will be able to obtain compensation for costs incurred due to the accident .
even if you don't know who hit you , there are ways to obtain compensation for the damages inflicted in a hit - and - run crash .
whether you work with an attorney to find the driver or pursue compensation through your personal injury protection coverage , there are ways to make sure you get the financial help you need after an accident .
