wladimir klitschko defended his ibf heavyweight crown by stopping hasim rahman in the seventh round at sap arena on saturday .
klitschko , who has not lost in more than four years , hit the shorter rahman at will throughout , and after landing a left-right-left combination against the cornered american , the referee stepped in to end the contest. rahman did n't appear upset .
klitschko had knocked down rahman in the previous round with successive left hooks .
the technical knockout in klitchsko 's sixth defense of the ibf belt - and third this year - improved the ukrainian-born fighter to 52-3 with 46 kos .
rahman , the two-time heavyweight champion who stepped in as a replacement opponent last month , struggled to get inside the taller klitschko 's reach , and dropped to 45-7-2 .
the fighters started out fast and light on their feet , but it soon became apparent that rahman was struggling to overcome the 3 1/2-inch height advantage enjoyed by the champion .
rahman had to lean in drastically , and klitschko easily fended off his punches .
rahman did little more than lean on the ropes for a time and guard his face as klitschko sought his opening .
rahman looked reinvigorated in the fourth round , using his whole torso to make ambitious attacks , often connecting with klitschko 's body .
but he rarely landed blows above klitschko 's shoulders , and the consequences were clear when klitschko dropped rahman early in the sixth with two hard lefts to the side of his head .
rahman got up but spent the remainder of the round in the corner , taking a sustained beating .
another flurry at the opening of the seventh ended rahman 's challenge .
klitschko also retained the minor wbo and ibo belts .
klitschko was originally scheduled to face alexander povetkin ( 16-0 ) , but the russian pulled out with an ankle injury .
rahman , who won the wbc and ibf belts from lennox lewis in 2001 and the vacant wbc belt in 2005 , arrived in germany on monday and declared he was in top shape .
on the undercard , former heavyweight champion riddick bowe made a modest comeback with an eighth-round decision over germany 's gene pukall .
it was just the third fight in a decade for the 41-year-old american and his first in three years .
bowe ( 45-1 , 33 kos ) had been training in germany since september in an effort to get his stamina up and his weight down .
the work paid off in the ring , where he kept up with the 33-year-old pukall ( 14-13-2 , 12kos ) and bested him with a stream of careful head shots .
