canadian authorities filed charges on wednesday against the leader of a group that openly practices polygamy in british columbia and has links to u.s. polygamist communities , local media reported .
winston blackmore and another member of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints ( flds ) were arrested for violating a little-used law against polygamy , the vancouver sun reported on its website , citing court documents .
prosecutors and police refused to comment on the reports , but have scheduled a news conference in vancouver to discuss legal action involving two people from the religious community in bountiful , british columbia .
blackmore , 52 , was not available for comment .
the flds , an offshoot of the mainstream mormon church , also has communities in the united states , where its leader and self-proclaimed prophet , warren jeffs , has been convicted on charges of forcing underage women to marry older men .
british columbia attorney general wally oppal appointed a special prosecutor in june to investigate laying charges against the flds , which is believed to have about 700 members living in southeastern british columbia .
oppal had to use a special prosecutor because the province 's regular prosecution service had been openly reluctant to press polygamy charges on the grounds that the law might be ruled unconstitutional as a violation of religious rights .
blackmore has challenged authorities in the past to file charges against him , and has denied any criminal wrongdoing within the community .
