"she believed they were spraying chemicals at her , saying things behind her back , " clark said .
after leaving the break room , hiller went down a hallway and fired shots at the supervisor who had suspended her and at a mechanic who was using a walkie - talkie to alert police and co - workers to her whereabouts , police said .
she missed both .
hiller finally went to a second - floor office and called police to tell them what she had done , authorities said .
seven other workers were hiding in a closet nearby .
cpl . janice leader , a 911 dispatcher , told reporters friday that hiller called 911 , saying "i'm the one you're looking for" and reporting that she had been harassed at work .
keeping her on the line , leader said she told hiller to put the gun down and place her hands on her head so officers wouldn't take any aggressive action against her .
