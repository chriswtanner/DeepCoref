bountiful polygamous leaders charged .
rcmp sgt. tim shields and attorney-general wally oppal announced wednesday that the rcmp arrested two bountiful residents , winston k. blackmore , 52 , and james oler , 44 , on charges of polygamy .
the arrests are the culmination of the most recent seven-month charge assessment review by special prosecutor terrence robertson .
shields said both oler and blackmore were arrested wednesday morning without incident by eight plainclothes rcmp officers in unmarked vehicles .
both men are currently in the cranbrook rcmp detachment lockup , but are expected to be released once they appear before a justice of the peace wednesday afternoon .
the polygamy charge against blackmore involves 20 individuals , while the charge against oler involves only two .
blackmore leads about half the bountiful commune , while oler leads the other half .
last june , oppal hired robertson to investigate whether charges should be laid against the openly polygamist members of the bountiful commune , where older men routinely are married , legally and common-law , to much younger women .
oppal instructed b.c. 's criminal justice branch to review the latest developments in an ongoing police investigation and reconsider criminal charges , after two previous prosecutors warned such charges could trigger a charter challenge based on freedom of religion .
oppal has stated his intention to punish any transgressions of laws to protect children .
blackmore recently accused oppal of religious persecution for pursuing the police investigation .
