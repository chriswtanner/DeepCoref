vincent 'the chin' gigante , last of mafia giants , dies .
mob boss vincent "the chin" gigante , the powerful mafioso who avoided jail for decades by wandering the streets in a ratty bathrobe and slippers , feigning mental illness , died monday in prison .
he was 77 .
the head of the genovese crime family , who had suffered from heart disease , died at the federal prison in springfield , mo . , said prison spokesman al quintero .
it was the same place where rival mob boss john gotti died of cancer in 2002 at age 61 .
gigante's death also was confirmed by christine monaco , a spokeswoman for the fbi , the organization that worked for years to put him behind bars .
dubbed the "oddfather" for his bizarre behavior , gigante had scored a lengthy string of victories over prosecutors , but it ended with a july 1997 racketeering conviction .
he was sentenced to 12 years in prison .
after a quarter - century of public craziness , he finally admitted his insanity ruse at an april 2003 federal hearing in which he calmly pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice .
that brought him another three - year sentence .
at that hearing , he chatted amiably with his son , shook hands with defense lawyers and said "god bless you" to u . s . district judge i . leo glasser .
for the man described by the new york times magazine as "the last great mafioso of the century , " his admission was the final act in a 50 - year career linking the era of old - time gangsters and the modern - day mafia of gotti .
at the height of his power , gigante's empire stretched from little italy to the docks of miami .
mob experts called him a traditional boss who settled issues by whatever means - verbal or violent - were required .
denying he was a gangster , gigante would wander the streets of the greenwich village neighborhood in nightclothes , muttering incoherently .
relatives , including a brother was who a roman catholic priest , insisted gigante suffered from paranoid schizophrenia , dementia and alzheimer's disease .
authorities charged it was a brazen act to avoid the law - although it wasn't until 1997 that a jury agreed .
the trial was a spectacle , with gigante in a wheelchair , mumbling silently , seemingly oblivious to the proceedings .
his lawyers claimed they could not communicate with him in any "meaningful way . " .
none of that swayed jurors , who convicted gigante of racketeering , extortion and plotting the murder - never carried out - of ex - mob associate peter savino .
born in the bronx in 1928 , one of five sons of italian immigrant parents , gigante became a small - time boxer and drifted into the crime family founded in 1931 by legendary gangster charles "lucky" luciano .
in 1957 , gigante was the hitman in a botched attempt to assassinate then - boss frank costello .
after refusing to name his attacker in court , the shaken costello retired , making gigante's patron , vito genovese , kingpin of the family that still bears his name .
over time , gigante , a stocky figure with a pugilist's face and 1940s pompadour , proved better at beating the law than gotti , the so - called "teflon don" who won two acquittals before tapes and turncoats sent him to prison for life .
before 1997 , gigante had served only a five - year heroin rap in 1959 .
