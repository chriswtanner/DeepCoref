a shocking video released for the first time thursday captures the moment a brooklyn mother of 12 was killed in a gang shootout as she picked her daughter up from school .
the dramatic footage was shown at the trial of two local toughs charged with killing zurana horton , 34 , on oct . 21 , 2011 .
at 2 : 18 p . m . , horton and two other moms are seen approaching a brownsville intersection as a yellow school bus rolls up .
a commotion breaks out as the three mothers and two children press up against a storefront for safety .
horton pushes a child out of the way , grips her chest , then collapses to the ground next to a pool of her own blood .
"i saw her fall back . . .
i saw blood coming from her , " testified unique armstead , the mother in the video wearing a white jacket , seen enveloping herself around her son as they dive to the ground just feet from where horton was killed .
armstead was shot in the left arm .
andrew lopez , 20 , is accused of firing indiscriminately at rival gang members from a nearby rooftop .
his half - brother , jonathan carrasquillo , 24 , who allegedly instructed lopez to take care of their enemies , is also on trial for murder .
armstead , 32 , testified that after she overheard someone say "he has a gun , " she took refuge inside a corner bodega with her son , who was celebrating his 11th birthday that day .
they stepped out less than a minute later when it looked like the threat was over , she said , but then shots started to ring out .
"i thought it was a brick but it was a bullet , " armstead testified .
"i told my son , 'i think i'm shot . ' " .
an 11 - year - old girl , cheanne mcknight , was grazed in the cheek .
lopez is accused of spraying 13 shots on a friday afternoon , just as schools were being let out .
horton's senseless death shook the city and highlighted the scourge of gun violence that plagues its hardscrabble neighborhoods .
the two juries hearing the case - one for each defendant - showed little emotion as the disturbing tape was played in court .
horton's mother , denise peace , said she is now caring for five of her daughter's orphaned kids while their father is looking after seven others .
of the alleged gunman , she said , "he's a menace to society . " .
the trial will resume monday with testimony from a man who purportedly told prosecutors he has been threatened with death by lopez's brother .
after the witness , who covered his face with a hoodie , was heard in an empty courtroom , the judge ruled he can testify in open court .
but justice vincent delgiudice made clear the witness is reluctant to take the stand .
"the man is petrified , " he said .
"the man is an emotional wreck . " .
