the case first captured the nation 's attention when laci peterson disappeared from her modesto home the day before christmas 2002 and has engrossed the country ever since .
unlike on nov. 12 , when sobs filled the air as peterson was found guilty of murdering his wife and their unborn child , there was an almost surreal stillness in the courtroom while the death recommendation was announced .
peterson was convicted nov. 12 of first-degree murder for the death of laci peterson and second-degree murder for the death of their unborn son just before christmas 2002 .
the same jury that recommended peterson 's penalty found him guilty of the first-degree murder of his wife and the second-degree murder of his unborn child .
