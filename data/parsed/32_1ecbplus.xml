a goth was being questioned on suspicion of murder yesterday after his mother and sister were found dead at home .
john jenkin , 23 , was arrested near the terraced house where alice mcmeekin , 58 , and katie jenkin , 20 , and a dead dog , thought to be the family's pet collie , were discovered .
police were called by neighbours at breakfast time on saturday after they heard piercing screams coming from the house .
one said : "i heard screaming , really high - pitched screams in the early hours .
then later i heard more screaming .
it sounded like someone telling a dog to shut up . " .
alice lived in the pebble - dashed terrace in millom , cumbria , with ï¿½unemployed john .
the neighbour described him as a goth and he is said to have recently been in hospital .
katie was visiting her mum from cardiff , where she was at university .
a close friend of the dead mum said : "i can't believe it .
they all looked after each other after alice separated from her husband in the 1990s .
we were so close that katie thought of my mum as a second mum .
"john was a good kid , never one of those to get into trouble .
he idolised his mum and his sister .
his little sister was his world , and his mum was too . " .
alice was brought up in millom , where her father ran a greengrocer's and a fish shop .
she returned to her home town 12 weeks ago after a four year spell living in cardiff .
friends noticed she had lost weight and looked frail .
it is thought she may have been suffering from cancer .
another neighbour added : "she went down to wales to give her kids a better life .
katie got into cardiff university , i think , and john was at college doing something in special effects .
"when alice came home , john came with her .
as far as i know he didn't have a girlfriend .
katie still lived in wales and had been going out with her boyfriend for two years .
"she came up for the weekend on friday .
alice met her at the station . " .
security worker alice had recently been upset by the death of one of her four cats and had taken in a collie dog called fenn .
the friend said she was "bubbly" when she saw her on friday .
she added : "we were chatting for about half an hour .
she told me katie was coming and she was so looking forward to it . " .
cumbria police have not disclosed how alice and katie died .
a police spokesman said : "we do not suspect anyone else to be involved . " .
detective chief inspector paul duhig said : "events such as these are rare in cumbria .
we are doing all we can to bring the offender to justice . " .
