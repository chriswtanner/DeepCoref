amd completes seamicro acquisition headed to $9 .
amd has completed its acquisition of seamicro as part of its strategy to regain lost server market share from intel and better position itself against future competition from arm - based players such as nvidia .
we previously wrote on how amd can benefit from this acquisition ( see amd picks up seamicro to strengthen server market offering ) .
here we take a brief look at the price that amd paid for seamicro , and what this implies about its growth expectations .
amd shelled out $334 million for the acquisition of seamicro .
since seamicro " s revenues or other financials were not disclosed , it becomes difficult to gauge whether the price paid was cheap or steep .
however , based on certain assumptions , it is possible to understand the range of amd " s growth expectations from seamicro .
for the purpose of calculations , we assume that seamicro operates at ebitda margin of close to 25% and apply similar corporate expenses ( as % of revenues ) including taxes , capital expenditures and others that we apply for amd .
if we assume seamicro " s revenues for 2012 will be somewhere around $50 million , it implies that amd expects seamicro " s revenues to grow at an average annual rate of 43% to 44% over the course of our forecast period , which extends till 2018 .
these revenues include both seamicro " s revenues as well as incremental benefit in server - related revenues from the acquisition .
on the other hand , if we assume seamicro " s revenues for 2012 to be of the order of $150 million , it implies that amd " s growth expectation for seamicro and related incremental server revenues stands at somewhere around 16% to 17% .
according to amd " s own calculations , it has paid a handsome price for the acquisition .
our price estimate for amd stands at $9 . 21 , implying a premium of little under 15% to the market price .
