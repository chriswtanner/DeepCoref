microsoft issues patch to fix ie .
microsoft has issued a security patch to fix a critical vulnerability in its internet explorer browser which it said has attacked over 2m windows users .
the flaw is believed to have already infected as many as 10,000 websites .
the " zero day " exploit let criminals take over victims ' computers by steering them to infected websites .
microsoft 's christopher budd said the software giant " encourages all ie customers to test and deploy this update as soon as possible " .
he also said the threat led microsoft to mobilise security engineering teams worldwide to deliver a software cure " in the unprecedented time of eight days " .
the company 's security response team said the patch consists of more than 300 distinct updates for more than half-a-dozen versions of ie in around 50 languages .
" even with that , the release emergency response process is n't over , " said security response alliance director mike reavey .
" there is additional support to customers and additional refinement of our product development efforts . " .
microsoft stressed that the flaw was proven to exist only in ie 7 on all applicable versions of windows , but that ie 6 and the " beta " release of ie 8 were " potentially vulnerable " .
users who have automatic updates turned on will receive the patch over the next 24 hours while others can access it via a download .
the azn trojan has been making the rounds since the beginning of december but became public knowledge in the last week .
unlike other exploits , users only have to visit a malicious site with trojans or other malware in order to become contaminated .
once an infected web page is opened , malicious downloaders are installed on the computer designed to record keystrokes and steal passwords , credit card details and other financial information .
the sites affected are mostly chinese and have been serving up programmes to steal passwords for computer games which can then be sold for cash on the black market .
internet explorer is the world 's most widely used web browser with nearly three quarters of the market share .
microsoft estimated that one in every 500 windows users had been exposed to sites that tried to exploit the flaw and the number of victims was increasing at a rate of 50 % daily .
researchers at the software security firm trend micro said attacks were spreading " like wildfire " .
" this vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber-criminals and getting worse every day , " said the company 's advanced threat researcher paul ferguson .
microsoft labelled the bug as " critical , " the most serious threat ranking in its four-step scoring programme .
the update is something of an unusual move for microsoft and underscores the seriousness of the zero day flaw .
the company rarely issues security fixes for its software outside of its regular monthly patch updates .
meanwhile mozilla has released a scheduled update for its open source firefox web browsers for at least 10 different vulnerabilities .
the bugs in the browser could have been " used to run attacker code and install software , requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing , " said mozilla .
it is also reissuing calls for users to upgrade from firefox 2.0 to firefox 3.0 as soon as possible and said it is " not planning any further security and stability updates for firefox 2 " .
this means mozilla will no longer support the firefox 2 browser against future online scams and attacks .
