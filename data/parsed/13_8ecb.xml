sarah palin actually apologized after the evangelical church she attends was nearly destroyed by arsonists -- all because she still harbors guilt over her failed vp run .
officials estimated the fire caused around $ 1 million in damage to the wasilla bible church -- which sarah hoped was n't in connection to the " undeserved negative attention " from her failed campaign , according to the sun times news group .
the police have no leads at this time -- and john mccain has not been named as a suspect .
