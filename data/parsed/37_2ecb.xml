a strong earthquake rattled indonesia 's west papua province wednesday just days after a powerful quake levelled buildings and killed one person , the united states geological survey said .
the 6.1-magnitude quake was the latest in a series of dozens of powerful tremors to have hit the region since 7.6 and 7.5 magnitude quakes that struck off the provincial capital manokwari on sunday .
wednesday 's shallow quake hit at 7 : 48 am ( 2248 gmt tuesday ) just off the coast , some 75 kilometres ( 50 miles ) west of manokwari .
officials had been put on alert to deal with more devastation to the area -- where thousands of people have been living in tents since sunday 's quakes -- but no damage or injuries had been reported , provincial disaster chief rahimin kacong was quoted by afp as saying .
the quake was accompanied by smaller quakes with a magnitude over 5.0 off kupang in east nusa tenggara province and ternate in north maluku province , indonesia 's seismological agency said .
around 14,000 people flooded into camps on high ground in the aftermath of sunday 's quakes fearing deadly waves after authorities issued and then withdrew a tsunami alert .
many refugees have returned home but some remain too fearful to go back kacong said .
" we already told people to return to their houses following the meteorological office report saying that the frequency of aftershocks has reduced , " he said .
hundreds of government and private buildings have been damaged by the sunday quakes , as well as seven bridges , two of which have collapsed .
the tremors have re-awakened bitter memories of similar deadly quakes that hit manokwari in 2002 , as well as the asian tsunami that killed 168,000 people in indonesia 's aceh province and nias island in 2004 .
