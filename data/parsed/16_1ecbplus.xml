district attorney steve cooley announced today that capital murder charges were filed against a hawaiian gardens gang member accused of gunning down deputy luis gerardo ( jerry ) ortiz a month ago .
cooley said jose luis orozco was charged with murdering the 35 - year - old deputy on june 24 outside a hawaiian gardens apartment .
the complaint alleged three special circumstances that would make orozco eligible for the death penalty : murder of a peace officer during performance of his duties , lying in wait and murder to avoid arrest .
" deputy ortiz was killed while investigating a shooting in which the defendant was a suspect , " cooley said at a news conference at the bellflower courthouse .
" he was shot in the head and left dying on the ground while his killer ran away and tried to hide .
" law enforcement officers like deputy ortiz are the last line of defense between criminals and the law - abiding citizens they protect .
when one is killed , all of us lose .
we will not let their killers go unpunished , " the district attorney said .
orozco , 27 , was found hiding in a house a few doors away from the shooting some hours after deputy ortiz was slain .
he was arrested and remained in custody on a parole hold .
" the defendant " s custody status gave sheriff " s detectives and our prosecutors in the crimes against police officers section ( capos ) additional time to fully investigate this murder and the case on which deputy ortiz was working when he was killed , " cooley said .
" having time to do the fullest investigation possible results in a stronger criminal case . " .

the defendant , who lives in hawaiian gardens and also is known by the street moniker of sepe , is charged in case no . va089897 filed this morning by deputy district attorney lowell anger of capos .
although filed as a capital case , the district attorney " s office will decide closer to trial whether to seek the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole .
orozco is charged with one count of murder of a peace officer with the special circumstances of murder of a peace officer during performance of his duties , lying in wait and murder to avoid arrest .
it was alleged the defendant personally used a handgun to commit the crime .
