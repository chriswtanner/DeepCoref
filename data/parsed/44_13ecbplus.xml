during his keynote at oracle openworld , hp ceo mark hurd gave his views on market consolidation .
it's an appropriate setting given oracle has made 41 acquisitions in 45 months totalling .
hp is no slouch at acquisitions in its post - compaq era , with more than 20 in the last few years , including mercury for $4 . 5 billion for and most recently opsware for $1 . 6 billion .
today , hp announced a small acquisition , eyp mission critical facilities , a datacenter consulting service with 350 employees , while oracle took a day off from its pursuits , which recently included bea .
hurd sees continuing industry consolidation and vertical integration going forward , which is no surprise .
lately , some mid - size companies being bought out by private equity firms , and the larger companies are still on the hunt .
today , ibm took out cognos for $5 billion .
but he seems to suggest that the market is shaping up for some very large scale transactions in the next few years .
"in the end , math wins .
a handful of players have in excess of $100 billion in cash revenue .
we'll see more consolidation , not less .
at the same time , we are all getting a push from an it perspective to do more standardization and to have fewer suppliers , " hurd said .
over time , fewer suppliers means moving from the large buying the small - and medium - sized to the large munching on the large , more mergers of near equals , carving up the market into fewer fiefdoms within the complex bounds of global regulatory approval .
"it could happen in two or three years if the right alignment of players occurs , " he added .
hurd didn't elaborate on the "right alignment of players , " and made a point of saying that he wasn't making a prediction .
he explained that companies with lots of cash can pay dividends to shareholders , buy back stock or make acquisitions .
"you have to measure the value of the three choices , and in many cases potential m&a activities will rise to the top . " .
"you can figure it out as well as i can , " hurd told the rapt openworld crowd .
"the numbers won't mislead you . " .
hurd is well known for his acumen with the numbers , but gave no further insights .
following the trajectory of the numbers for a moment , it's not that far fetched to see hp and oracle in a consolidation supernova if the planets align in a certain way .
or , how about sap and ibm , or some other combination .
or cisco and hp .
or microsoft and ? ? ?
take your pick .
it's just ungoverned speculation , but consolidation in maturing market tends toward singularity .
of course , that could be the beginning of the end for those long established brands , as google or a company no one had heard of rears its head and completely changes the rules of the game .
