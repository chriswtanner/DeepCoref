wednesday , july 28 , 2004 .
fred larue , a watergate figure and high - ranking nixon administration official who once was rumored to be deep throat , has died of natural causes .
he was 75 .
his body was discovered tuesday by a maid who entered his hotel room in biloxi , coroner gary hargrove said .
larue was known as the "bagman" who delivered payoffs to keep participants in the watergate break - in quiet , and served 41 / 2 months in federal prison for conspiracy to obstruct justice .
larue served as special assistant to john mitchell , the former attorney general who later headed president nixon's re - election committee .
larue was present at a 1972 meeting with mitchell and nixon aide jeb stuart magruder at nixon's vacation home in key biscayne , fla . , where the plan to break into the watergate complex in washington allegedly was hatched .
larue said he advised against the burglarization of the building , which housed democratic party headquarters .
after his political career ended in scandal , larue returned to his home state of mississippi to work in his family's oil company and with its real estate holdings .
larue discounted rumors that he was deep throat , saying the mysterious source for washington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein on the watergate story was not one person , but probably a combination of several people .
