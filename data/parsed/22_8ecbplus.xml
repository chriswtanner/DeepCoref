police say two people have been killed and another wounded in a shooting at the kraft foods plant in northeast philadelphia .
the alleged shooter is in police custody .
kyw " s pat loeb reports that the shooting took place just after 8 : 30pm thursday night inside the old nabisco factory , along the 12000 block of roosevelt boulevard , at woodhaven road .
authorities say the incident began after the fifteen - year employee , 43 - year - old yvonne hiller , was suspended .
police commissioner charles ramsey says she was escorted out of the building and was outside for nine minutes before coming back .
" she drove her car through a barrier and entered the premises .
she had a . 357 magnum .
made her way to the third - floor mixing room , where she encountered at least three of the employees .
two , she shot and killed there in the room .
a third was also shot . " .
the third victim , identified as brian dalton , was rushed to aria health " s torresdale campus with a gunshot wound .
he was later transferred to jefferson and listed in stable condition .
officers responded to 911 calls from other employees inside the building , arriving with swat teams and other personnel who were trained in an " active shooter " situation , according to commissioner ramsey .
he says most of the other 100 workers inside were able to get out safely .
seven employees were trapped near the shooter , but cops say they were able to free them , disarm the woman , and take her into custody .
kyw " s paul kurtz reports that commissioner ramsey credits a special training program for preventing even more bloodshed last night .
the commissioner says he " s put many officers through what " s called " active shooter " training for first - responding officers .
" we " ve learned from columbine and other places that you can " t wait , you can " t just sit there and wait for swat .
you " ve got to at least make entry and try to get as many people out as possible , isolate the shooter , and then hopefully swat arrives in enough time to take care of the situation .
they did an excellent job , the 7th and 8th districts in particular .
those officers did an outstanding job . " .
and it turns out that at least seven of the officers who rushed to the kraft factory had " active shooter " training .
ramsey says he plans to expand the program .
hiller is expected to be arraigned on two murder charges and one attempted murder charge later today .
kraft foods issued a statement early this morning announcing that the northeast facility is closed until further notice .
the statement expresses condolences for the families of the dead and wounded employees , saying , " this is a tragic loss for all of us . " .
it states that kraft is working closely with the authorities as they investigate and will be providing counseling services for employees at the facility .
