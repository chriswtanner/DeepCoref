chris weitz is in negotiations to helm " new moon , " the sequel to summit entertainment 's vampire breakout " twilight . " .
weitz comes on board to helm the second installment in stephenie meyer 's four-book series after summit and " twilight " director catherine hardwicke failed to reach a deal on the new movie .
the weitz move prompted a carefully calibrated campaign of reassurance on the part of creators .
meyer penned a letter that sought to calm fans nervous about the midstream switch .
" i 'm sad that catherine is not continuing on with us for 'new moon , ' she wrote in a letter on her web site , but then noted that , with weitz .
" torches and pitchforks are n't going to be necessary . " .
the director " is excited by the story and eager to keep the movie as close to the book as possible , " she wrote .
" he is also aware of you , the fans , and wants to keep you all extremely happy .
it 's rare for the director of a successful first picture not to continue on with the sequel .
there have been conflicting reports about hardwicke 's departure , with some noting creative and other differences .
summit has said it was a matter of scheduling .
weitz has not helmed a girl-oriented project before but has been involved in movies that encompass elements featured in " twilight , " producing the teen-aimed coming-of-age tale " american pie " and directing the fantasy adventure " the golden compass . " .
still , the director was taking few chances .
" i promise to remain responsive to your hopes and fears , " he wrote in his own letter to fans saturday .
" i thank you for this opportunity and for your faith . " .
weitz said he had been " in a whirlwind romance " with the series over the past few days , and , in a particularly careful phrasing , said he is " very grateful to have received ( meyer 's ) permission to protect 'new moon ' in its translation from the page to the screen . " .
both weitz 's and meyer 's letters represent rare attempts to communicate with fans on issues often left mostly to the industry , and speak both to the intense insider interest of fans as well as the importance of that group to the franchise 's success .
summit a week ago had faced a public-relations challenge when some fan bulletin boards began to worry about hardwicke 's departure .
robert pattinson and kristen stewart will star in " moon , " while melissa rosenberg is writing the picture which , like the first , centers on the ordinary teenager bella and the vampire edward but adds jacob , a werewolf character who figured less prominently in the first film .
the budget for " moon " is expected to be slightly higher than the first in the franchise , with a release likely for late 2009 or early 2010 .
