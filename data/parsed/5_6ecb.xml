the sixers have disappointed this season , just 9-14 despite the inspired 2007-08 run ( which culminated in taking two of six against the pistons ) and the pick-up of dominant pivot elton brand over the summer .
if you do n't know by now : you disappoint in the nba , you get canned .
today , maurice cheeks became the fifth coach fired within the first quarter of the season .
at this point , the emotional roller coaster of the nba season seems much more telling to any particular coach 's fortunes than overall performance .
reggie theus , long in danger , pulled off a huge upset of the lakers on tuesday .
he 's expected to stay safe barring a basketball apocolypse ( or a bad loss to the knicks tonight ) .
marc iavaroni of memphis got a win at an opportune time this week .
sure , it was over the thunder ... but whatever .
( also , his owner is being cheap right now . ) .
cheeks had an opportunity to turn things around this week with a home-and-home against the cavaliers , a team many picked the sixers to eclipse this season .
the cavs won the set by a combined 24 points and have the league 's second-best record .
while fellow fired coaches eddie jordan and sam mitchell seem assured of another top job as soon as next year , cheeks surprisingly figures to land closer to the randy wittman/p.j. carlesimo pile .
many felt cheeks was the victim of a regime change and not his own failure in portland ; as such , he seemed like a safe pick for the philly job ( especially considering his history in the town ) .
but although there has been change in the sixers ' front office ( current gm ed stefanski did n't hire cheeks , in other words ) , this sacking is more tied to the team 's failure .
you fail 1.5 times in today 's nba , you might be done for a while. cheeks is smooth and well-liked , so he could get a gig soon enough .
but it seems more likely that he 'd get back on the bench as an assistant or move to a college program .
