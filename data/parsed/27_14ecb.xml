with web attacks increasing , microsoft fixes ie bug .
security experts say that web surfers should immediately install a new bug-fix for microsoft 's internet explorer browser , released wednesday morning .
the flaw , which was accidentally made public by chinese security researchers just over a week ago , has been used in a growing number of web-based attacks over the past few days .
criminals have posted attack code that exploits this flaw on thousands of web sites so far , according to rick howard , intelligence director with verisign 's idefense group .
verisign has now seen six variants of the attack software , all of which attempt to steal chinese online gaming credentials .
often the attack is launched through a hidden iframe component that is surreptitiously put on a web site .
verisign has even spotted one such iframe attack on a legitimate financial institution 's web site , howard said .
" the volume of iframes deploying this thing is really high . " .
the flaw lies in the way internet explorer 's data-binding function works , microsoft said .
when the browser is attacked it will crash , corrupting the computer 's memory and allowing the criminal to run unauthorized software .

because internet explorer is used by about 70 percent of web surfers , this attack code will probably show up in widely used malicious software toolkits " very shortly , " howard said .
other security companies agreed with verisign 's assessment .
" microsoft 's latest ie out-of-band patch release needs to be installed right away , " said shavlik technologies in a statement .
" the number of infected web sites is growing at an alarming rate -- even people visiting legitimate web sites are getting hacked with this exploit . " .
the flaw is so serious , in fact , that microsoft took the unusual step of issuing its security fix weeks ahead of schedule .
typically microsoft releases security patches just once a month in order to simplify the lives of system administrators .
its next set of updates is due jan. 13 .
criminals could also launch their attacks via e-mail , by sending victims maliciously encoded html documents , although this type of attack has not been reported .
microsoft 's patch is for users of ie version 5 and up .
