it 's official : chris weitz is taking over the director 's chair for the " twilight " sequel " new moon . " .
" twilight " author stephenie meyer confirmed the news on her official website saturday morning in a post designed to calm the rising anguish among fans who loved the first film adaptation .
after bidding a fond farewell to " twilight " director catherine hardwicke , meyer went on to praise weitz and to let fans know that " torches and pitchforks are not going to be necessary . " .
on the one hand , weitz has shown his skill at adapting popular modern novels for the screen -- " about a boy , " from the nick hornby novel , won weitz and co-scripters paul weitz and peter hedges an oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay .
on the other hand , weitz also directed last year 's " the golden compass , " which was an expensive mess that failed to capture the fan base of the book .
