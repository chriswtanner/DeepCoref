leflore jury : simpson guilty of killing pregnant girlfriend .
a spiro man was found guilty of two counts of first - degree murder thursday evening in the 2012 shooting death of a fort smith woman and the subsequent death of her 8 - to 12 - week - old fetus .
a nine - woman , three - man leflore county jury deliberated almost seven hours before finding christopher kenyon simpson , 27 , guilty of two counts of first - degree murder .
jurors recommended the maximum sentence , life without the possibility of parole and a $10 , 000 fine on both counts .
formal sentencing is set for 11 a . m . nov . 8 before leflore county district judge jon sullivan .
flynn's father herbert flynn of fort coffee said later , "i'm glad it's over .
i'm glad we got the verdict we got .
she deserved it . " .
after the courtroom emptied , crawford county deputy prosecuting attorney jacob howell and district 27 assistant district attorney anthony evans credited the verdict in the complicated and mostly circumstantial case to smart , attentive jurors .
in closing arguments on the sixth day of simpson's trial , howell projected onto a video screen a photo of 20 - year - old victim ka'loni flynn's body sitting in the driver's seat of her car , bullet wounds to her forehead and temples .
some audience members gasped audibly in the crowded , otherwise quiet courtroom gallery .
"we know that's how we got here , " howell said , indicating the photo .
"i hope we showed you this was investigated thoroughly , and that every possible suspect was investigated and excluded except one , " howell said .
the prosecution contends simpson planned the murders , then shot flynn execution - style twice in the head on easter sunday , april 8 , 2012 , killing her and her fetus because he did not want another child to support , and flynn refused an abortion .
a dna expert testified earlier that simpson fathered the fetus .
howell contended simpson's planning began in early april 2012 when he asked mackenzi clayton , a relative , about tracking a pay - as - you - go phone .
throughout the investigation and court proceedings , simpson repeatedly denied having bought such a phone despite a walmart video showing him doing so , then on wednesday he testified he bought it , but for clayton , not for himself , howell said .
howell reminded the jury that flynn's roommate testified flynn left their apartment around 10 : 30 p . m . april 8 , a time matching the 10 : 30 p . m . call simpson's cousin's wife testified she saw him engaged in at her garage .
howell reminded jurors that verizon wireless , cricket wireless and federal bureau of investigation cellular analysis experts testified about how the calls between the phone simpson purchased and flynn's phone pinged in cell towers covering the u . s . 271 corridor where simpson planned to spend the night with his cousins in fort smith and the rural mcginnis lane area between pocola and spiro where flynn's body was found .
between 10 : 37 and 10 : 58 p . m . april 8 , the pay - as - you - go phone called flynn's phone six times .
arkansas state trooper mary minor testified she pulled flynn over at 10 : 46 p . m . for speeding on interstate 540 .
flynn was heading toward oklahoma , minor stated .
howell said at 11 : 01 p . m . flynn's phone called the pay - as - you - go phone , and two employees of the sac - n - pac near mcginnis lane testified they heard two to three gunshots around 11 p . m .
howell contended simpson's whereabouts were not accounted for between 10 : 30 p . m . and 11 : 21 p . m . , when he made a purchase at an e - z mart near his cousins' home .
and howell reminded jurors that simpson's cousins testified they became concerned about simpson's prolonged absence for the quick trip to the e - z mart and called him three times beginning at 11 p . m .
those calls rolled to voice mail .
in his closing statement , defense attorney warren gotcher of mcalester argued that the two sac - n - pac clerks stayed outside on their smoke break for 10 minutes after hearing the gunshots and never saw a car exit mcginnis lane .
gotcher argued the timeline evidence showed simpson couldn't have been involved .
he said area resident erica hawkins saw flynn's car in the roadway at 11 : 41 p . m . , and pulled around to shine her bright headlights on it .
he reminded jurors that hawkins testified the driver's window was rolled down and she saw a red light inside the car , but she didn't see anyone in the car .
gotcher suggested the light could have been from a phone charger found unattached on the seat next to flynn .
gotcher said when deputy terry springwater arrived on the scene around 3 a . m . april 9 , the car window was rolled only three - fourths the way down , the parking lights were on , the trunk was unlatched and there was a body in the car .
gotcher reminded jurors an oklahoma state bureau of investigation expert testified that flynn's body had not been moved after she was shot .
"sometime between 11 : 41 p . m . and 3 a . m . , the window was rolled three - fourths the way down , parking lights turned on and trunk unlatched and maybe the phone charger disconnected , " gotcher contended .
he contended , too , that clayton testified as the prosecution wished because he was afraid his parole would be revoked , and that simpson's cousins , likewise , testified as they had because they'd been threatened with a firearms charge and having their child taken away .
evans contended simpson attempted character assassination of flynn and attempted to divert blame for her murder to others because "the defendant has the spotlight on him , and it's hot , and he needs to get it off him .
so what does he do ?
he pushes it over here .
desperate men do desperate things . " .
evans contended simpson destroyed or manipulated evidence throughout the investigation .
"i submit to you that beyond a reasonable doubt , the defendant is guilty of killing ka'loni flynn , and when he shot her , he also killed his own child , " evans said .
