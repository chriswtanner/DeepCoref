rbc capital markets downgraded ati technologies to " sector perform " from " outperform " after advanced micro devices announced its intention to buy the canadian graphics chip-maker for $ 5.4 billion on monday .
even though the takeover looks fairly valued , rbc analyst steve arthur said there is limited upside to the offer unless competing bids are made for ati .
for now , arthur said amd 's takeover deal , which is expected to close in the fourth quarter , effectively offers his one-year price target of $ 21 now .
that price target was set prior to the takeover bid and factored in ati 's gross margin leverage , capital expenditure strength , a competitive product lineup and the launch of microsoft ( nasdaq : msft - news - people ) windows ' new operating system , vista , which would be a " net positive " for graphics-chips vendors .
without a competitive bid to drive shares higher , ati is unlikely to outperform , warranting a " sector perform " rating in the analyst 's view .
arthur said a competitive bid is possible but the two most-likely bidders , intel ( nasdaq : intc - news - people ) and nvdidia , face prohibitive anti-trust challenges. combined , ati and intel would have 68 % overall market share in pc graphics , while an ati-nvidia partnership would effectively capture 100 % of the discrete graphics market .
other counteroffers could be made by texas instruments ( nyse : txn - news - people ) and broadcom ( nasdaq : brcm - news - people ) , which , according to arthur , would n't so much face anti-trust challenges as they would compatibility challenges .
