obama overturns bush midnight rules on science , health care .
mar 5 , 2009 .
controversial rulings enacted in the 11th hour by the bush administration are being examined for policy and legal implications by the obama administration .
several regulations affecting health care and the environment have been overturned .
in his final months in office , former president george w . bush enacted several highly controversial policies that affect health care and wildlife .
in just a little over a month in office , president barack obama has sidelined or overturned several of them , and has also reached back over the years to reverse policies enacted during bush " s first term .
a bush administration draft plan to allow oil and gas drilling off the atlantic and pacific coasts was sidelined by the obama administration on feb . 10 .
"to establish an orderly process that allows us to make wise decisions based on sound information , we need to set aside" the plan , said new interior secretary ken salazar who extended the public comment period on offshore drilling by six months .
obama has maintained that expanded offshore drilling should be part of a larger energy blueprint developed out in the open with congress , not within the departments of commerce and interior department alone .
on feb . 27 , the obama administration announced its intention to reverse the so - called " medical conscience " rule , following a 30 - day comment period .
the rule gave health care workers the right to refuse to participate in services they consider immoral .
the rule was vaguely worded and extended the right to refuse service to everyone from receptionists and janitors to hospital executives and insurance company ceos .
opponents considered the rule , which took effect the day before obama " s inauguration , a thinly veiled maneuver to limit access to legal abortions , contraceptives , and living will directives .
on march 3 , obama overturned another 11th hour bush regulation that weakened the endangered species act and pitted federal agencies against each other .
the regulation allowed federal agencies to sidestep scientific evidence gathered by u . s . fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service experts when launching construction projects that impact endangered wildlife .
when overturning the regulation , obama said he was restoring "the scientific process to its rightful place at the heart of the endangered species act , a process undermined by past administrations . " .
the obama administration will also move quickly to reverse some older bush rulings .
on january 30 , obama signed an executive order rescinding a 2001 bush policy change that barred u . s . financial aid to international organizations that provide or promote abortions .
first implemented by president reagan and called the " mexico city " rule , the policy is reversed whenever there is a change in ideology in the white house .
obama said the policy toward international family planning "has been used as a political wedge issue . " .
he said his administration would " initiate a fresh conversation on family planning , working to find areas of common ground to best meet the needs of women and families at home and around the world . " .
the obama administration plans to head off many of bush " s midnight hour rules still in the pipeline before they take effect .
on inauguration day , federal agency heads were sent a memo stating that they should freeze all bush regulations in the pipeline .
office of management and budget director peter orszag followed up with a jan . 21 memo giving agency heads these options for dealing with bush - era " rules which raise substantial questions of law or policy : " extending the effective date of a rule , reopening the notice and comment period , issuing interim final rules , and deciding not to defend court challenges to bush administration rules .
