red sox to break bank for teixeira .
here's a prediction : by the time this is over , win or lose , the red sox effectively will have made mark teixeira the largest contract offer in the history of your storied franchise .
when the sox want something enough , they make sure they get it .
in the case of teixeira , rest assured that the sox want him , no matter what games are being played by club officials .
publicly and privately , the sox are saying nothing about their interest in teixeira and playing dumb every time his name comes up .
it's as sure a sign as any that they are preparing to go to extraordinary lengths .
what the red sox truly fear here is that the yankees can outbid them on teixeira , explaining why the sox have failed to confirm any interest in the player at all .
with the possible exception of the new york mets , who just exercised their contract option on first baseman carlos delgado , the yankees are the only team in baseball who could outbid the red sox for teixeira's services .
the yankees could do it in a big way , too , giving teixeira the kind of money that would put him in the clouds with alex rodriguez .
