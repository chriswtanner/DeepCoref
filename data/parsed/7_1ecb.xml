wladimir klitschko ( 52-3 , 46 kos ) blasted a sluggish hasim rahman ( 45-7-2 , 36 kos ) in mannheim , germany on saturday night to retain the ibf , wbo and ibo world heavyweight titles .
after flooring rahman in the sixth round with a left-right combo klitschko wasted little time wrapping it up in the seventh with a big left-right-left series that led to the referee stepping in and stopping the fight at the 2:15 mark .
rahman , a former heavyweight champion who shocked the world when he floored lennox lewis in 2001 for the title , showed absolutely no signs of life against kiltschko on saturday .
the final numbers showed klitschko landing 178 of 369 punches thrown while rahman connected on just 30 of 207 punches thrown .
