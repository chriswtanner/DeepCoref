hansbrough breaks 30-year-old unc scoring mark .
forward tyler hansbrough broke north carolina 's all-time scoring record in thursday 's game against evansville .
phil ford 's school mark of 2,290 points set in 1978 held strong amongst a plethora of talented tar heels over the years , but hansbrough , who came back for his senior season after being crowned the national player of the year , moved into the top spot with a tough leaner in the lane with two purple aces defenders hanging on him with 7:42 left in the first half .
the game was stopped and ford was on hand to congratulate hansbrough at half-court .
the missouri native suffered through a shin injury earlier in the season that forced him to miss four games .
in the five games he played before thursday 's action , hansbrough averaged a team-high 22.8 points to go with 7.2 rebounds .
in 113 career games prior to thursday , the forward has logged 20.2 points and 8.6 rebounds in just under 31 minutes an outing , while doing a lot of damage at the free throw line with nearly nine attempts per game .
hansbrough , who has an outside shot at edging duke great j.j. redick for the all-time acc scoring record ( 2,769 points ) , has succeeded in just about every statistical category , though he is still searching for the elusive fifth national title for the program , which moved to 10-0 after its 91-73 drubbing of evansville .
hansbrough finished the game with 20 points and nine rebounds .
