sudan 'bombs refugees' in south sudan's unity state .
south sudanese officials have condemned sudan after an aerial bombardment of a refugee camp in their territory .
the bbc's james copnall was at the yida camp in oil - rich unity state , which borders sudan , when it was bombed .
local official miabek lang said at least 12 people had been killed and 20 wounded .
the sudanese military , which has been fighting rebels in areas near south sudan , has denied the claims .
our reporter says he arrived at the camp at about 12 : 00 gmt on thursday as a second round of bombs hit .
he says that just as a un helicopter , carrying food aid , settled on to a makeshift landing zone at the camp , there was a deep and terrifying thud of a nearby explosion .
a large plane was spotted heading to the north , our reporter says .
'completely false' .
several residents of the refugee camp told him it was an antonov plane , often used by the sudanese government as a makeshift bomber .
the refugees said the plane had circled before launching two bombing raids .
five bombs were dropped , of which four exploded , they told our correspondent .
our reporter says he did not see any casualties , but mr lang , the commissioner of pariang county in unity state , said that 12 people had been killed and the death toll could rise .
incidents like this , and both sides' belief that the other is sponsoring rebels on their territory , are contributing to a rapidly deteriorating relationship between sudan and south sudan , he says .
thousands of people who have fled fighting in sudan's south kordofan region have crossed the border to take refuge at the yida camp .
sudan's army has often been accused of bombing south kordofan , where it is facing a rebellion from pro - southern groups .
our reporter says there is talk that rebels use the camp to rest before returning to south kordofan to fight .
the refugees are , however , furious with sudan's president omar al - bashir over the bombings , he says .
the governor of unity state , taban deng , said mr bashir should be held responsible .
"why does omar bashir do this ?
he has a lot to answer , " mr deng said .
however , sudan armed forces spokesman sawarmi khaled saad vehemently denied any links to the raid .
"this information is completely false .
we didn't bomb any camps or any areas inside the borders of south sudan , " he told the afp news agency .
"what is going on in south sudan belongs to the southerners .
we don't have any links to this . " .
the south sudan liberation army rebel group is active in unity state - it denies claims that it is working for khartoum in order to destabilise its neighbour .
south sudan gained independence in july under a peace deal which followed decades of north - south conflict .
