oh , it 's been so long since we were on the rehab beat !
after telling people in october that she did n't " need to do any of that anymore , " " american pie " actress and former travel reporter tara reid checked into promises treatment center on friday for an unspecified problem .
promises is a celeb favorite favored by britney spears and lindsay lohan -- it 's also where mel gibson retired to after his 2006 accident and anti-semitic outburst .
not quite the christmas alternative we 're looking for ... .
get well soon , tara !
