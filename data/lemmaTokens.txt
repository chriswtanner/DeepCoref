what the red sox truly fear here be that the yankee can outbid they on teixeira , explain why the sox have fail to confirm any interest in the player at all .
with the possible exception of the new york met , who just exercise they contract option on first baseman carlo delgado , the yankee be the only team in baseball who could outbid the red sox for teixeira service .
the yankee could do it in a big way , too , give teixeira the kind of money that would put he in the cloud with alex rodriguez .

there be every indication that the red sox view teixiera in the same must - have light as they do matsuzaka .

report : red sox make huge offer to teixeira .
on tuesday , 16 december 2008 13 : 45 .
the boston red sox have make the biggest offer in club history to mark teixeira .
the deal be say to be for 8 year and could be up to 180 million .
with the economy go down and ticket price freeze you have to wonder how the red sox plan on make this kind of committment for the long term .
do this mean they will not be able to get that big free agent next year or the year after that ?
the farm system have be good but it can not replace eveything and the sox be go to need some front line starter in the next few year .
we just have to say in theo we trust with this one .
thursday , december 11 , 2008 .
prediction : red sox will nab teixeira .
espn be report that the national have offer mark teixeira a 8 - year , 160 million contract .
at the same time , si . com be report that , '' the red sox be one of the most aggressive pursuer of teixeira , with several executive predict he may wind up there . '' .
the national '' offer set the bar for teixeira '' s service .
will the sox have to offer more money and / or year , or do playing in boston , for a win team , with very a passionate fan base mean more than play near he hometown in maryland ?
naturally scott bora will try to draw this out as long as he can .
however , teixeira have say he would like a resolution by christmas .
the question be , now that the angel have lose out on cc sabathia , will they be all the more motivated to retain teixeira ?
could they swoop in with a overwhelming offer ?
the la time say the angel be reluctant to go past seven year for teixeira .
and though they still need more pitching , the yankee can never be discount .
however , unfortunately for the angel , ken rosenthal of fox sport report that two major - league source say teixeira would prefer to be on the east coast for family reason .
with that in mind , the national and oriole be push hard to bring teixeira back to the maryland area .
last night , rosenthal report that , accord to a major - league source , the red sox be make progress in they quest to sign teixeira .
'' headway be be make earlier today , '' the source say .
and a rival general manager whose plan could be affect by the red sox '' s addition of teixeira also indicate that a deal be get closer .
teixeira be seek a 10 - year contract for at least 20 million per season .
the red sox preference would be to sign he to a deal between six and eight year .
the free - agent first baseman will be 29 on april 11 , coincide with the opening week of the 2009 season .
by all indication , he '' be a solid long - term investment .
eight year seem like a reasonable contract - length for a player of teixeira '' s age and ability .
but if the sox be push to 10 year , they would likely deem it acceptable .
they will do whatever it take to get it do .
teixeira be the big fish they '' be determine not to let slip away .
have never hit fewer than 26 homer in he six major - league season , teixeira certainly seem like a better long - term investment than sabathia .
pay astronomical money to a guy who play every day make more sense than guarantee it to one who play every five day , and who have weight issue .
question about he long term durability will continue to dog sabathia for at least the next couple of year .
teixeira remain the hottest commodity on the free agent market because he '' be be durable , injury - free , and highly productive .
over six full season , he career stat line look like this : . 290 average , . 919 op , 203 hr , 676 rbi .
last season , split between the brave and angel , teixeira hit . 308 , with 33 home run and 121 rbi .
he '' be proven himself in both league .
he be a all star , a two - time gold glove winner , and a two - time silver slugger winner .
without question , teixeira be a very solid hitter and a bona fide slugger ; he be one of just five player in major league history to hit at least 100 home run in he first three season .
for these reason , he have be describe as the '' apple of theo epstein '' s eye . '' .
this be why the red sox will not fail in they effort to bring home they single highest priority this offseason .
accord to this l.a. time story -lrb- which credit the team-owned flagship radio station -rrb- , the angel have make a eight-year offer to free agent first baseman mark teixeira .
the dollar amount be unspecified , but bill shaikin , the fine reporter who write the story , say the team be believe to have offer at least $ 160 million .
this , obviously , change the landscape of the teixeira sweepstakes , as the national ' best chance for landing he be to blow everyone else out of the water with they offer -- which , apparently , have not happen .
that be not to say the national can not sweeten they offer , but team official have indicate a unwillingness to get into a bidding war with higher-revenue team .
of course , we still have yet to hear from the red sox -- or even the yankee , as i hypothesize in today 's print edition .
in any case , it appear this thing be far from over .
red sox extend offer to teixeira .
boston reportedly look to ink free - agent slugger for eight year .
12 / 16 / 08 1 : 30 be est .
though the red sox continue to operate in intriguing secrecy when it come to they pursuit of free - agent slugger mark teixeira , it appear a offer have be transmit from the office of 4 yawkey way in boston to the corporation of power agent scott boras in southern california .
the boston herald report in its tuesday edition that the red sox have extend a offer for teixeira , believe to be the longest and richest in the seven - year history of the ownership group lead by john w . henry .
though the newspaper do cite its source , it state that the offer be believe to be for at least eight year . '' .
the red sox have a club policy of not comment on they negotiate stance with any free agent .
last week at the winter meeting , the washington national make teixeira a eight - year , 160 million offer .
angel general manager tony reagin recently confirm that he club have also make a eight - year offer .
the oriole , accord to report , have offer teixeira a seven - year deal worth between 140 million and 150 million .
as for the red sox , gm theo epstein have so much as utter teixeira name in any interview with media member this offseason .
that have always be the way epstein conduct he business , and it why you not hear any public comment from the red sox regard teixeira until he either sign with boston or go somewhere else .
be be aggressive , really aggressive on player that we like , '' epstein say last week .
the two biggest investment the red sox have make under current ownership ?
a 103 . 1 million sum - - include the 51 . 1 million post fee - - to daisuke matsuzaka over six season and a five - year , 70 million contract for j . d . draw .
though break the bank in free agency not typically the way the red sox go about they hot stove business , they feel that teixeira - - who will turn 29 in april - - could be the centerpiece of they lineup for the better part of a decade .
the switch - hitter do everything the red sox like , from get on base to hit for power to play terrific defense at first base .
epstein be ask at the winter meeting if the red sox could sign a marquee free agent this winter .
i think there a chance of it , '' he say .
there definitely a chance that we not .
i not tell you which -lsb- answer -rsb- , eight , 10 , 12 year from now would have be better for the organization .
but player that we like and think can help we , be go to try to sign to number that we think be reasonable and help we go forward and help we with we foundation .
if we get they , great .
if we not , then will move on . '' .
the yankee , boston top rival , have already make a loud statement this winter , agree to term with starter cc sabathia and a . j . burnett .
though epstein never like to act as if he be counteract the yankee , teixeira would clearly give boston lineup a more dynamic look .
there have be conflict report as to whether the yankee have interest in teixeira .
when boras speak at the winter meeting , he do sound as if he be in any rush to close the teixeira deal .
back in november , while attend a georgia tech football game , teixeira tell espn that he like to sign by christmas .
if the red sox be successful in landing teixeira , it will create a somewhat sticky situation .
the red sox have kevin youkilis at first base and mike lowell at third .
to open a spot for teixeira , the red sox might have to trade lowell and move youkilis across the diamond .
however , lowell , come off right hip surgery , be likely to have to prove he health in spring training if he be to be deal .
last winter the red sox re - sign lowell , the most valuable player of the 2007 world series , to a three - year , 37 . 5 million contract .
the red sox control youkili contractually for the next two year , so it highly doubtful he would be move .
youkilis finish third in the american league most valuable player voting in november .
david ortiz , boston star designate hitter , be a 10 - 5 man -lrb- 10 year in the major , five with the same team -rrb- , mean he could veto any trade .
8 : 24am .
accord to michael silverman of the boston herald , the red sox make a offer to mark teixeira .
silverman believe it to be for eight year .
tex be believe to be seek more than 21mm per year , closer to alex rodriguez 27 . 5mm per year .
the angel be reportedly at eight year and at least 160mm , the oriole around seven year , 140 - 150mm , and the national at eight year , 160mm .
red sox - teixeira rumor .
december 15 , 2008 at 1 : 00pm cst .
2 : 16pm : take it with a grain of salt , but we have a report of a report that the red sox offer mark teixeira a eight - year , 200mm deal .
earl bloom of the orange county register hear dan patrick say it on he radio show .
it be best to treat the report with skepticism until it confirm by another source .
angel general manager tony reagin confirm to the lo angele time that he have make a eight-year offer to free agent first baseman mark teixeira .
regain do not reveal the dollar amount , but the newspaper speculate the deal be worth at least $ 160 million .
teixeira be consider the top offensive player available on the free agent market , and the oriole -lrb- seven year , $ 140 $ 150 million -rrb- and national -lrb- eight year , $ 160 million -rrb- reportedly have make sizeable offer as well .
the red sox , consider to be the front-runner for teixeira , also have put in a bid , though monetary detail have be keep quiet .
there have be talk of the yankee be in the teixeira sweepstakes as well .
teixeira , 28 , have hit at least 30 homer and drive in at least 105 run in each of the past five season .
after be acquire from the brave before the trading deadline this past season , teixeira hit .358 with 13 homer and 43 rbis in 54 game with the angel .
boston red sox majority owner john w . henry , ceo larry lucchino and general manager theo epstein fly to texa on thursday night to meet with free agent mark teixeira and he agent , scott bora , in a effort to convince the switch - hit first baseman to sign with boston .
the red sox have make a eight - year offer to teixeira in excess of 160 million , but source close to the negotiation say it be less than the 184 million report by boston wcvb sportscaster mike lynch , who first report that the meeting would take place .
the meeting will not result in a '' take it or leave it '' scenario by the red sox , a source say .
however , henry say earlier this week that the red sox will not satisfy boras '' request for a 10 - year deal , and it appear highly unlikely that boston will go beyond eight year .
the party be meet at a undisclosed location in texa , the red sox have request the face - to - face meeting with the player so he can hear directly from they why they believe he should spend the next eight year in boston .
the lo angele angel , baltimore oriole and washington national also have make offer to teixeira , but to date none of those offer be believe to be for more than eight year .
yankee general manager brian cashman also meet with teixeira earlier this month , but that be before the yankee commit more than 240 million to sign pitcher cc sabathia and a . j . burnett , so it appear unlikely they would make a grab for teixeira as well .
boras also represent free - agent catcher jason varitek , the red sox captain who decline a offer of salary arbitration from the team .
boston have not make another offer to varitek since , though the side continue to talk .
a third boras client , free - agent pitcher derek lowe , also be of interest to the red sox , but they have not make he a offer and be expect to do so only if he drop he price .
lowe be believe to be seek a five - year deal in the 75 million range .
teixeira , who turn 29 on april 11 , have average more than 30 home run and 100 rbis in he six big - league season , while post a . 919 op and play gold glove - caliber defense .
the red sox envision he as a middle - of - the - lineup presence to offset last july '' be departure of manny ramirez to the dodger .
if teixeira sign with the red sox , they would move all - star kevin youkili from first to third base while look to trade third baseman mike lowell , the 2007 world series mvp .
the lo angele angel of anaheim offer free-agent first baseman mark teixeira a eight-year contract at the winter meeting in las vegas .
owner arte moreno meet with scott bora , teixeira 's agent , and present he with the offer , which be believe to be worth at least $ 160 million and possibly as much as $ 180 million over the life of the contract .
'' it be something they can consider - or should consider , '' angel general manager tony reagin tell mlb.com on friday .
'' they have the right . '' .
other team in the battle for teixeira be the baltimore oriole -lrb- seven year , $ 140-150 million -rrb- , washington national -lrb- eight year , $ 160 million -rrb- and boston red sox .
the new york yankee also have express interest .
teixeira , 28 , be acquire by the angel in a july 29 deal with the atlanta brave last season and hit 13 home run and 43 rbis in 54 game .
overall , he finish the season with a .308 average , 33 homer and 121 rbi .
it mark the fifth straight 30-homer , 100-rbi season for teixeira .
he bat .467 with seven hit and four walk in the american league division series as the angel fall to the red sox in four game .
national eight - year offer to teixeira reportedly bump as high as 184m .
december 23 , 2008 .
for week now , mark teixeira have contemplate he next home - - a wait game that have slowly shorten the list of team in pursuit of he service .
but evidently , the waiting have cause teixeira price tag to drop even the slightest .
one report post online last night by masn sport roch kubatko suggest that the washington national have upgrade they initial offer to teixeira - - eight year , 160 million - - to somewhere between 178 million and 184 million over the same timeframe .
no member of the team front office would add comment yesterday on the current offer or indicate whether the team have sweeten the deal .
by way of decline to offer the number of washington proposal to teixeira , team president stan kasten say , there be bargain , but luxury goods be still not be discount . '' .
regardless of the money , the team front office still know it would take a mild upset for the 28 - year - old to settle on a deal with washington .
on sunday night , the lo angele angel withdraw they contract offer to teixeira , believe he have no sincere interest in play for the organization with which he end the 2008 season .
the boston red sox and baltimore oriole have offer on the table , and though they have yet to make a concrete offer the new york yankee might also contemplate a last - minute bid .
various news report late last week peg the boston offer to be as high as 184 million over eight year , though subsequent rumor suggest that the number be a little lower - - perhaps between 165 million and 180 million .
the oriole have the weakest offer of the bunch - - a proposal reportedly worth between 140 million and 150 million over seven year .
so far , no team involve have offer a contract longer than eight year .
teixeira agent , scott bora , enter the free agency process hope he client could attract a 10 - year deal .
either way , teixeira will end up with one of the biggest payday in baseball history , almost certainly exceed the 161 million -lrb- over seven year -rrb- that fellow free agent cc sabathia receive from the yankee earlier this offseason .
the angel have offer a eight-year contract to mark teixeira , general manager tony reagin say friday night .
the contract would be the longest and richest in club history .
the value could almost double the previous club record , the $ 90 million guarantee last year to torii hunter .
reagin decline to provide the value of teixeira 's offer .
the angel be believe to have offer at least $ 160 million , match or exceed the highest offer so far report for teixeira .
owner arte moreno fly from he arizona home to las vegas on tuesday and meet personally with scott bora , the agent for teixeira .
angel spokesman tim mead say he believe moreno present the offer to bora at that time .
mead also say he do not know when the offer might expire .
none of the other team in the teixeira sweepstakes -- the boston red sox , baltimore oriole and washington national -- have be report to have offer more than eight year .
the national reportedly have bid $ 160 million over eight year , the oriole between $ 140 million and $ 150 million over seven year .
the detail of the boston bid have not be report .
the angel have exclusive negotiating rights with teixeira for the first 15 day after the world series , but they decline to make a offer during that time and say they would do so at a appropriate time .
boras have have one month since then to solicit bid from other team , enable he to let moreno know how the market have develop and enable moreno to make he first -- and perhaps only -- offer without bora shop that offer to other team .
the angel have not waver from treat teixeira as they top priority , even as other coveted option have evaporate .
the angel negotiate with pitcher cc sabathia , a favorite among they scout , but they choose not to make a offer after decide they would not match the new york yankee ' initial $ 140-million bid .
sabathia agree to a seven-year , $ 161-million deal with the yankee late tuesday night , hour after moreno meet with boras .
on friday , outfielder raul ibanez sign a three-year , $ 31.5-million contract with the philadelphia philly .
the angel have consider signing ibanez if they lose out on teixeira , with ibanez playing leave field and kendry morale replace teixeira at first base .
the angel ' eight-year offer first be report friday night on the team-owned radio station , be 830 .
source : sox may not be out of teixeira chase .
team exec meet with player agent .
update 3 : 09 be est dec 19 , 2008 .
despite say they have be outbid for free agent first baseman mark teixeira , the red sox do not believe they be completely out of the chase , sportscenter 5 have learn .
source have also tell sportscenter 5 mike lynch more about the negotiation that take place thursday at teixeira texa home .
lynch report the red sox team of owner john henry , coo larry lucchino and general manager theo epstein offer teixeira , 28 , a eight - year deal worth 184 million or 23 million per season .
it be then that agent scott bora counter by ask for a eight - year contract worth 200 million , source say .
lynch report that henry become infuriate at that point , balk at the massive sum .
in a e - mail to media member thursday night , henry say , we meet with mr . teixeira and be very much impressed with he .
after hear about he other offer , however , it seem clear that we be not go to be a factor . '' .
henry reference to the other offer leave open the possibility that he be call bora bluff , who have be know to inflate the value of offer and the number of suitor pursue he client , lynch report .
boras represent former red sox center fielder johnny damon , who sign with the new york yankee in 2005 after the boston brass apparently refuse to believe that the offer from they archrival be real .
lynch also learn that one of teixeira hometown team , the washington national , have make a huge offer .
teixeira be a maryland native .
teixeira be trade from atlanta to lo angele in july .
he hit . 308 with 33 homer and 121 rbis last season , include . 358 with 13 homer and 43 rbis in 54 game with the angel .
the angele say last week they make a eight - year offer .
henry have express concern about a contract of eight year or more .
we all have limit , '' he write the ap on wednesday .
eight year be a very long time in baseball and everywhere else . '' .
he also say the amount the team be willing to spend on a free agent depend on both the economy and the player be seek .
super-agent scott bora say leave the winter meeting that it be go to take a eight-year deal to get the service of slug first-baseman mark teixeira .
the angel apparently be good with that .
lo angele general manager tony reagin have sound like a broken record say that resign teixeira be he top priority , and back that up now with a eight-year offer .
no dollar figure have be release with the offer , but the seven-year offer for teixeira be in the $ 140 million to $ 160 million range and the new offer be expect to be at the top of that range .
if accept , this would certainly be the largest contract in the angel history , dwarf the four-year , $ 90 million deal that torii hunter get just last summer .
but if he keep mash like he do after the trade , teixeira could be worth the bank .
in 54 game with the angele he hit .358 with 13 home run and 43 rbi , and have a slug percentage of .632 .
the two-time gold glove winner also help solidify the angele infield .
after the winter meeting , the conventional wisdom be that the red sox be the frontrunner for teixeira 's service , even though they meet privately and they offer be never make public -lrb- maybe that be why people think they be the leader -rrb- .
however , no other offer -lrb- include from the national and oriel try to bring teixeira back to he native maryland -rrb- be think to be more than seven year .
the race for teixeira seem to be in the final furlong .
but then again , boras be a patient man , especially if he think more money could be around the corner .
the lo angele angel make a eight-year offer to first baseman mark teixeira during winter meeting in las vegas .
team spokesman tim mead confirm sunday the angel have withdraw they offer and be '' out of the mark teixeira derby . '' .
the team make its offer , reportedly worth about we $ 160 million , during the winter meeting in las vegas earlier this month .
the red sox say last week that they '' be not go to be a factor '' in sign the 28-year-old maryland native .
washington and baltimore have express interest in teixeira .
the angel obtain teixeira from the atlanta brave in late july .
play in a combined 157 game with the angel and brave , teixeira have 33 homer and 121 rbis along with a career-best .308 average .
teixeira not head to boston .
can you believe it ?
i can '' t .
yet it '' be come from up top .
red sox owner john henry have say , in so many word , that he team will not sign mark teixeira .
he exact word .
'' we meet with mr . teixeira and be very much impressed with he .
after hear about he other offer , however , it seem clear that we be not go to be a factor . '' .
you can follow the entire saga on mlb trade rumor .
no one expect this , at least not this soon .
the red sox , the team so many consider the frontrunner for teixeira , will , in the word of the owner himself , not be factor .
it appear , from henry '' s word , the price tag be a bit too high .
report of the red sox offer vary , though wcvb - tv claim it be eight year and 184 million , or a 23 million average annual value .
boston could obviously jump back into the picture , but for now it appear they '' ll let the first baseman sign elsewhere .
clearly , i expect a flurry of '' now the yankee have to get he '' comment .
think about this , though .
there '' s at least one offer out there better than eight year and 184 million .
should the yankee go higher than 25 million a season for teixeira ?
so as thing turn out , apparently there be team in major league baseball not name the new york yankee who be willing to spend money this winter .
after let francisco rodriguez leave to join the new york met and fail to sign cc sabathia , the angel find themselves with some money lay around , and they have decide to spend it on mark teixeira .
accord to a report in the lo angele time , the angel have make a offer to the free agent first baseman that would be the biggest contract in the history of the franchise , surpass the $ 90 million deal they give to torii hunter last season .
while the number be not confirm , the deal be believe to be a offer of eight year and around $ 160 million .
owner arte moreno fly from he arizona home to las vegas on tuesday and meet personally with scott bora , the agent for teixeira .
angel spokesman tim mead say he believe moreno present the offer to bora at that time .
mead also say he do not know when the offer might expire .
the angel , of course , be one of four team that be know to be pursue teixeira .
the national offer he the same deal as the angel , the oriole have make a offer between $ 140 and $ 150 million over seven year , and nobody know for sure what the red sox have offer .
i be pretty sure the red sox offer will be the only one the angel have to compete with because even though the national and oriole be close to teixeira 's home , neither have any realistic expectation of compete for a world series next season , with or without teixeira .
in other news , somewhere manny ramirez just punch something .
with last night 's news from lo angele angel gm tony reagin that the team have make a eight-year contract offer -lrb- dollar undisclosed -rrb- to 1b mark teixeira , the trade rumor be report , most recently by john perrotto at baseball prospectus , about the angel go after san diego padre ' ace be likely caput .
perrotto 's iteration have aaa rhp nick adenhart and aaa ss brandon wood head a package that would lead to peavy top the angel ' rotation .
while the angel be be lump in with the big spender of baseball -lrb- read : new york yankee and boston red sox -rrb- , there be little to indicate the angel ' off-season plan include drop $ 20mm per on teixeira and another $ 15 + mm on a start pitcher .
as a back-up plan to a failure to land teixeira , yes .
however , a interesting scenario develop if teixeira spur the west coast in favor of work closer to home for the washington national or baltimore oriole .
in this scenario , the angel would have the luxury of deal peavy to the padre for a wood/adenhart/reggie willits/reliever package , and revive its offense with the signing of non-tender 3b/2b ty wigginton and jonny gome .
first base : boston in good spot for teixeira .
december 22nd , 2008 8 : 55 be .
the angel have withdraw they offer to free - agent 1b mark teixeira , report foxsport . com and yahoo ! sport .
in fact , angel gm tony reagin later confirm the report to the lo angele time , add that he be no longer pursue teixeira .
similarly , buster olney of espn . com believe the national do not expect to sign teixeira , despite make a eight - year offer .
meanwhile , accord to the newsday , teixeira still have a eight - year offer on the table from the red sox , worth roughly 22 million per season .
... ok , so , the sox have the high offer , the angel be out , the national lack confidence , and the o '' s have reportedly only offer seven year ... which would suggest the red sox be in very , very good position to land teixeira ... unless , of course , a new team can be wrangle in to the mix ... .
in a earlier report , newsday report that teixeira '' s agent , scott bora , be work to get the yankee involve again .
olney believe brian cashman make teixeira a offer earlier in the off - season , but have since pull it back .
... in case you '' be wonder , six article and the met be not mention once as ever have interest in teixeira ... .

a 57 - year - old wasilla woman have be indict by a federal grand jury on charge she defraud the state of alaska and lie to the u . s . department of agriculture during the operation of the now - defunct matanuska creamery .

the indictment also say she submit false document to convince the usda in 2008 to waive its prohibition on use dairy and ice cream - make equipment at valley dairy as collateral on state loan .
the equipment be purchase in 2007 use federal grant that didn '' t allow the equipment to be sell or encumber without special authorization from the usda .
alaska dispatch have more here .
by the mid - 1980s , mat maid be falter , and a state - run corporation take over management .
it struggle until sarah palin become alaska governor .
she arrive on the scene shortly before the state board of agriculture and conservation , which have watch the dairy bleed cash for year , vote to deny it further loan .
with that move threaten to kill the dairy , palin fire the board and appoint another , which vote to give the dairy more money .
that go on until the new board realize , as do the old board , the dairy just could compete in the real world of modern - day alaska with cheaper milk ship in from the lower 48 .
enter beus , then a valley dairy farmer , and bob havemeister , another dairy farmer .
they form a joint venture to take over the equipment and operation of mat maid in a effort to keep it alive .
beus be the one who eventually end up with most of the equipment and set up a company call klondike creamery and candy , which briefly market ice cream in alaska .
it be not long , however , before it be roll into valley dairy - - a joint effort of beus , robert well and olson .
olson be the former alaska state executive director of the u . s . department of agriculture farm service agency , a job she hold from 1993 to 2001 .
olson have insist in a number of interview with alaska dispatch that the only interest she ever have be try to keep the dairy business alive in alaska .
after she join beus at valley dairy , the company begin effort to tap a 5 - million pool of usda money set aside for rural development .
beus be indict last year on charge he take at least 120 , 000 of that money for he own personal and discretionary use . '' .
where and when olson learn of he alleged activity be not explain in the indictment against she , but it say she devise a scheme to conceal the true nature of the valley dairy finances and the fraudulent activity of beus , and to obtain a loan from the arlf -lrb- alaska revolving loan fund -rrb- to keep the valley dairy , of which olson be a investor and employee , operating .

arson in alaska palin '' pattern '' ?
november 20 , 2012 .
there be a old say that '' once be chance ; twice be coincidence ; the third time be a pattern .
it be probably '' chance '' when the wasilla bible church be burn , and arson be suspect .
it be determine that a acelerant be place around the perimeter of the church .
no arrest be make in that fire .
the interesting part of that blaze report that it didn '' t harm the larger area of the church where worship service be hold .
instead it be , accord to sarah palin , the office where church record be store , that be destroy .
if there be church record that would reveal something sarah palin didn '' t want uncovered , the destruction of those record by fire would solve that problem .
when arson be suspect in the burning of the house of dar miller it be probably just coincidence .
it be probably just coincidence that sarah palin be not supportive of people who be homosexual , and it appear dar be lesbian , and live with she '' partner . '' .
of course it be not coincidence that dar miller be in she home when the fire break out and be burn so badly she die the next day .
it be not coincidence that she dog die in the fire as they live with she .
it be unusual that the dog die at the foot of she bed , instead of by the door , try to get out of the house .
it be probably just coincidence that dar miller have previously work at the mat - su regional hospital as a neo - natal nurse , which be the same hospital where trig be purportedly bear .
the curious thing be that there be never a arrest make in that fire either .
the suggest be that dar miller have probably be smoking in bed and catch herself and the bed on fire .
who make that suggestion ?
do they know that dar didn '' t smoke ?
-lrb- accord to ottoline comment in this blog -rrb- .
the fire that burn so hot that it '' char beam and melted picture on the wall '' doesn '' t sound like a fire cause by a cigarette in bed .
the troubling '' pattern '' emerge as there be report of yet another fire in the small community of palmer alaska .
this time the fire occur at the matanuska maid creamery .
you remember .
that dairy be the subject of a thorough investigation by andrew halcro .
andrew '' s suggestion be that sarah palin have fraudulently divert large sum of money to friend and high school buddy .
within a week of the dissolution of the last entity to run the matanuska maid creamery , its building burn to the ground .
arson be likely , give the fact that the building be without electrical or gas connection and the fire break out at 3 : 30 be .
all three fire appear to be the result of arson .
all three fire occur in or around the small town of alaska where sarah palin life .
all three fire may have confer some benefit on sarah palin .
when the church fire destroy church record , i suspect foul play , but know that it be probably just chance .
when dar miller '' be home be burn and she be kill by the blaze , i suspect foul play , but know that it could be merely coincidence .
now that the dairy have burn , and foul play seem clear , there be a unmistakable pattern .
give the fact that none of these crime have be '' solve , '' a pattern be emerge .
i wonder how long it will be before the anchorage police department will issue a press release state that there be not one scintilla of evidence connect any of the member of the palin family with these case of arson ?
gov. sarah palin 's home church have be badly damage in a suspicious fire .
larry kroon , pastor of the wasilla bible church , estimate damages at more than $ 1 million to the church .
kroon decline to say if the blaze be politically base or direct at palin , the failed republican vice presidential candidate .
kroon say the fire break out friday night while a small group of woman be work on craft .
they be alert to the blaze by a fire alarm .
kroon say he be call and by the time he get to the church , smoke be pour out of the building .
sprinkler keep the fire from spread beyond office and classroom .
authority be not immediately comment , but kroon say he be be tell the fire be be investigate as a crime .
arson suspect in fire that destroy alaska mat - maid dairy .
august 7 , 2012 .
only about a week after alaska official formally move to dissolve the last entity to run the historic matanuska maid creamery , the historic structure which once house part of that historic business burn to the ground in palmer .
arson be suspect .
you not call it arson yet , '' palmer public safety director jon owen say , but the fact that the 86 - year - old structure be without electrical or gas connection make the 3 : 30 a . m . fire highly suspicious .
there be no lightning strike , '' owen say .
it be a pretty morning in palmer when a visitor to the valley hotel walk out at 3 : 33 a . m . and spy the desert building nearby in flame .
by the time local police arrive to investigate , owen say , there be no hope of save the structure , and the fireman who arrive soon thereafter focus they effort on keep flame from spread to a nearby fuel storage facility .
a good portion of the fire - fight equipment in the matanuska valley be call to help , more than two dozen unit .
at one time , owen say , firefighter be pour 5 , 000 gallon of water per minute onto the blaze as history burn .
designate as national historic landmark , the mat maid building date back to the mid 1930 during president franklin d . roosevelt new deal effort to wrench the country out of the great depression .
they be build shortly after the matanuska colony be establish by the roosevelt administration to relocate struggle american and give they a new start in the last frontier .
a farmer cooperative at first , mat maid become a state - run business that eventually die despite the best effort of former gov . sarah palin to keep it alive .
now a conservative icon , palin be anything but in 2007 when the creamery corporation , '' a arm of the alaska board of agriculture and conservation , vote to close down a financially struggle mat maid .
palin respond by firing the board .
she then replace board member with she crony .
they pump another 600 , 000 in state money into mat maid , but it do help .
in july alone , they lose 300 , 000 , '' say anchorage businessman and blogger andrew halcro , a sometimes critic of palin .
by the end of 2007 , it be obvious even to the palin administration that mat maid could survive , and the state be force to shut it down although the creamery corporation survive .
it be only now go out of business .
dissolution of the corporation have take four year , '' robert mcfarlane , a assistant state attorney general say tuesday .
in the interim , a new creamery grow up in the matanuska - susitna valley to take the place of mat maid .
however , valley dairy inc . , seem to have many of the same problem that beset its predecessor .
creamery lack the cheddar .
at the start of the month , valley dairy inc . , which do business as the matanuska creamery , tell the agriculture board it be go to stop make payment on its hundred of thousand of dollar in debt to the state agriculture revolving loan fund -lrb- arlf -rrb- .
we will be make no further payment on we arlf note until we have be able to move to a suitable location and secure a minimum raw milk supply , '' karen olson , president and ceo of valley dairy , notify the panel on aug . 1 .
all we attempt to deal with we arlf loan have only result in a moment reprieve follow by further threat . '' .
a copy of the letter have be obtain by dispatch .
in it , olson blame the state for alaska dairy problem .
there be some who would say that matanuska creamery have be a victim of its own idealism and commitment to keep the dairy industry alive , '' she write , and they would be correct .
but have we ignore we commitment back in 2007 and since , there would be no dairy industry . '' .
the problem specific to the matanuska creamery date to the two - year reign of sarah palin , but the problem for the dairy industry in alaska go back way before she administration .
they be root in state - sponsor effort to create a industry instead of let market work .
go heavy on milk future .
mat maid do fine for 23 year without one single dime from the state , '' halcro say .
that change at the start of the 1980s when the state try to supercharge farming across cook inlet from anchorage by create the point mackenzie dairy project .
mat maid , a farmer cooperative begin in 1936 , try to help .
it borrow 2 million dollar from the agriculture fund to expand its facility to handle all the milk that be suppose to come from the farm .
when the farmer falter , mat maid be leave short of milk .
without enough milk to sell - - either as milk or cream or yogurt or cheese - - mat maid could generate enough profit to service its debt .
in 1983 , it be force to file for bankruptcy .
the state step in to run the company to protect its debt .
two year later , the cooperative sign over to the loan fund its property and asset to settle a 5 . 3 million debt .
three year after that , the state establish the creamery corporation as a arm of the loan fund to run mat maid .
it struggle along for almost a decade .
the creamery corporation have operate without financial assistance from the arlf since 1988 and continue to provide a return on investment thorough increase equity value , '' argue a white paper produce for the alaska department of natural resource in 2006 .
mat maid be then value at 5 million , down from a peak value of 5 . 3 million but above the 2002 value of 4 . 9 million .
the white paper note effort to privatize the operation in 1986 and again in 1990 have fail .
there be no bid .
the state be more successful in get rid of the historic creamery building in palmer although that , too , be a struggle .
they be lease with a option to buy in 1996 , but that deal fall through .
a restoration company call heritage property pick the building up in 1997 , and in 2001 announce plan to convert they into office and store , or apartment , while maintain they historic façades .
that idea , too , fall through , and the property be finally sell at bid .
it be purchase by anchorage attorney bill ingaldson .
he be not return call on tuesday .
ingaldson , as well as the state division of agriculture and other property owner , have be in negotiation with the city of palmer on the sale of what be call the old matanuska maid block . '' .
it be a area of about 8 . 7 acre near downtown palmer that include , until tuesday , the old creamery , a historic hatchery , a cinderblock power house , a residency , a building housing the office of the palmer art council , and crowley petroleum distributor , which maintain the fuel storage facility .
palmer voter in 2010 approve a 3 million bond to pay for purchase of the property .
there be hope of restore the building as a tourist attraction .
it could have detail the success and failure of those sort of collective effort sometimes attack by palin .
mat maid the co - op be a profitable business that once produce and sell about half the milk in alaska .
mat maid the state - own corporation be a company that struggle from the start and sell a lot of milk produce in the lower 48 .
in 2004 , 39 percent of the milk produce at mat maid be from alaska producer , '' the white paper say .
the other 61 percent be ship in from outside to be package and sell as alaska milk in a effort by mat maid to maintain market share in hope the cow on the state - sponsor farm at point mackenzie would one day start produce .
they never really do .
over time the mackenzie property begin to shift into the hand of land speculator anticipate some far - future wealth if a bridge be ever build across knik arm to allow for creation of a new anchorage bedroom community .
kind of a good question .
it all kind of a long and complicated story go way back , '' say ed fogel , the deputy commissioner of natural resource in charge of the agriculture division .
he could hazard a guess on how much money the state have lose on mat maid and associate agriculture project over the year .
that kind of a good question , '' he say .
darcy davy , a agriculture student at the university of alaska fairbanks , in 2007 author a senior thesis calculate money spend on agriculture project in the state .
davy write that over 76 million -lrb- in 2006 dollar -rrb- be spend on the project .
even more million of dollar be spend on the arlf loan to farmer . '' .
it be debatable , '' she write , whether those fund expend be worth the benefit create . '' .
davy examine not only point mackenzie and mat maid , but the delta barley project and a effort to produce red meat in the nenana area of the interior .
she report note that the point mac agriculture project get almost 10 million in direct appropriation .
it be unclear how many million more exactly be spend prop up mat maid .
after the fire , and the pend dissolution of the creamery corporation , about all that will remain be the mat maid trademark , a ice - skating princess in a fur hat .
the state own that , '' say fogel .
as the most durable legacy of mat maid , the trademark could prove valuable , though fogel be sure how the state could use it .
maybe it could festoon the 100 , 000 pound of matanuska creamery cheese the valley dairy put up to back one of its state loan .

in deny a automatic motion by the defense to reduce the jury recommendation from death to life in prison without the possibility of parole , hickok call the slaying of the newlywed deputy and father of two a cold - blood , vicious murder . '' .
colossal factor .
hickok say the aggravating factor in the case be colossal . '' .
he note the 29 - year - old gang member not only kill the deputy while hide outside of the lawman view behind a door , orozco also allegedly try to kill another man just a few day earlier by shoot that individual in the back twice , and have brag about kill the officer .
he have also boast prior to ortiz killing that he want to kill a cop , that he want to make a name for he gang , the judge add .

why do you do it ?
why do you have to stand behind a door like a coward ? '' the young widow read from the teen letter .

neither perlo nor he co - counsel , robin yane , ever claim they client innocence .
they client have commit the crime , both attorney say thursday .

a convict cop killer laugh tuesday after hear a jury ruling that he be put to death .
jose luis orozco show almost no emotion throughout the three - week trial in which he be convict of the 2005 murder of lo angele county sheriff deputy jerry ortiz .
a rare exception for the 29 - year - old hawaiian garden gang member be a occasional smile for he mother when he turn in he chair to glance back at she from time to time .
he will be sentence may 3 .
when the jury convict he last month of the deputy slaying , as well as the attempt murder of another man just a few day prior to the ambush killing of ortiz , orozco sit stare straight ahead , unflinching .
as court clerk dan fallon read the jury sentence shortly before noon tuesday , several member of the slay lawman family gasp , clutch one another hand .
at the same time , a small smile spread across orozco face and he chuckle .
we understand and we appreciate the gravity of the decision that the jury have to make ... ... ... , and that it take a lot for they to -lrb- come to that decision -rrb- , '' chela ortiz , the deputy wife , say afterward .
we appreciate everything they do , we know they be very careful ... ... ... and give this a lot of they attention . '' .
chela ortiz - who be marry three week before she husband be murder - sit with she mother in - law , rosa ortiz , and the rest of the family every day of the trial .
they be accompany by dozen of sheriff deputy and other family friend , include the family priest .
most day be difficult and fill with tear as they listen to chill testimony recount the last few minute of ortiz life and saw , for the first time , the crime scene and autopsy photo .
i think , for all of we , it be kind of relive the nightmare all over , '' chela ortiz say .
family member listen to testimony that include the defendant violent past and the many time he escape prosecution by use he gang influence and power to intimidate victim - include two nearly kill when they be shoot and stab in the back by orozco , accord to prosecutor .
orozco friend and fellow gang member also recall he boast about kill a cop one day .
i just say thank god it be over , '' the deputy mother , rosa ortiz , say .
it be too much some day ... ... ...
to I it be too hard . '' .
it take the jury of six man and six woman a little more than four hour , spread over two day , to choose death over life in prison without the possibility of parole .
it be almost the same amount of time use to come to the guilty verdict on march 20 .
accord to three juror who speak briefly outside the courtroom , the decision be a difficult one make slightly easier by the thorough job of the prosecutor and investigator .
none of they want to be identify because of the gang tie to the case .
the physical evidence , which include orozco dna and fingerprint find on the murder weapon , be overwhelming , they say .
there be also a number of eye witness include two girl who describe for the jury how orozco hide behind they front door and shoot the deputy as ortiz speak with they mother .
equally as damning , juror say , be the complete lack of remorse show by the defendant .
he squander two opportunity to turn he life around , include chance to relocate out of state and away from the gang with he family in las vegas and again with a friend and former gang member in florida , they say .
it look to they as though he prefer the life of a criminal and revel in the notoriety he earn in the deputy death .
a tape conversation between orozco and two friend - one a fellow gang member and the other a associate - in a holding cell at the bellflower courthouse make it clear to the jury that a life in prison would not diminish he threat to society , they say .
in that tape , orozco be hear talk about destroy evidence and order a hit on the two little girl and they mother - the star witness in the case .
i have to hear that tape again , '' one juror say .
because if we be go to send he to jail for life , he could run the same business from behind bar , '' a second juror add .
this way he not harm anyone anymore . '' .
apartment murder .
ortiz be assign to track orozco down the day before he june 24 , 2005 murder .
that task stem from the june 20 , 2005 shooting of a black man who - accord to prosecutor - orozco try to kill simply because of he race .
the 15 - year veteran , who learn the day before that he have make the rank of detective , be patrolling in hawaiian garden near 223rd street when he spot orozco and try to stop he .
the gang member take off run with ortiz behind he , accord to court testimony .
ortiz follow orozco to a apartment complex in the 12500 block of east 223rd street , to the home of one of orozco friend whom the deputy know from previous altercation , at about 3 : 30 p . m .
what ortiz do know be that orozco be lurk behind the woman front door .
as ortiz speak to she and reholster he weapon , orozco steady he hand while two of the woman child - girl age 6 and 8 - and several of she friend look on .
he fire just one shot from he . 38 - caliber revolver , with the slug pass through a crack in the door and hit the deputy in the side of the head .
the 35 - year - old newlywed and father to two boy die almost immediately .
tactical decision .
stan perlo , one of two court - appoint defense attorney assign to orozco , say the defendant lack of support from he family deal a massive blow to they case .
originally , orozco mother be to take the stand to tell she son story and talk about the many problem he face grow up , perlo say .
but she become nervous , tell she son the night before she be to testify that she do not want to go through with it , perlo explain .
orozco agree not to force he mother to have to take the witness stand , a decision that likely destroy he chance at any mercy on the part of the jury , he say .
we problem be we have no one to tell he story , '' perlo say .
we be count on he mom and ... ... ... she be too nervous to testify . '' .
perlo and co - counsel robin yane approach orozco case from a somewhat unorthodox position .
rather than argue they client innocence , they repeatedly refer to they client as the gunman in the presence of the jury and focus on a number of other people they claim be equally responsible in the crime .
it be a tactical decision reach by the two veteran attorney , both with extensive experience with death penalty case , and after consultation with they peer , perlo explain .
we make a lot of decision that some lawyer would disagree with , '' he say .
i would add , personally , a lot of lawyer with a lot less experience . '' .
long process .
when orozco return to court on may 3 , perlo and yane will argue for a mistrial and , if that be reject , will ask judge philip hickok to modify the jury verdict and consider life without parole .
the chance either argument will be successful be slight , perlo say .
but that then set into motion the automatic appeal process , something that will be handle by a different set of attorney .
during that time , orozco will not be house with the general population , he will have a cell all he own give he isolation from much of the gang violence in the state prison .
at the very least , perlo estimate the appeal process will last five year .
it could run into 20 year because there be both state and federal requirement that must be meet , he add .
a large part of the problem stem from find lawyer who be available for such a lengthy commitment of time , who be willing to take on a stressful job and who be qualify , perlo say .
the decision today make the family happy , but unfortunately it a false happiness , '' perlo say after court tuesday .
have deal with issue of death for many year ... ... ...
the death penalty rarely offer ... ... ... closure . '' .
the ortiz family , however , disagree .
be kind of relieved that it over , '' say 17 - year - old jeremy ortiz , one of the deputy son from a previous marriage .
be happy with the verdict , we just have to wait it out now . '' .
prior to the reading of the verdict , the deputy family and friend wait in a courtroom fill to capacity but so quiet one could could hear the slight squeak of the attorney leather chair .
some bow they head and rub they face , while other clasp they hand as though in prayer .
when the sentence be finally announce a collective gasp for air be follow by cry and sob as relative sit behind the family lean forward to rub they shoulder and give a comforting squeeze .
outside the courtroom , rosa ortiz take out a button with a laminated picture of she slay son in uniform and hand it to the eldest of she five child , art ortiz , so that he could pin it on she blouse .
once it be secure she kiss it tenderly .
for many minute afterward , relative and friend stand outside the courtroom hugging and cry .
detective dawn retzlaff , one of the two lead homicide detective on the case , say authority be grateful for the jury thorough and careful review of the fact and investigator be happy with the verdict , call it just .
speak on behalf of the sheriff department , retzlaff add that they want to express they condolence to ortiz family in what be a devastating time .
it not a happy day for anybody , '' say deputy district attorney lowell anger , who prosecute the case along with fellow da phillip stirling .
anger say that the message send by the jury sentence - that kill a police officer and flaunt all respect for authority and for life will not be tolerate - be clear .
it be the constant support from anger , stirl and the district attorney office , from the sheriff department and other law enforcement agency , and from the family large circle of friend that make the tumultuous trial more bearable , chela and she in - law insist .
we could never repay they for all the support and love they have for this family , and that they have for jerry , '' chela say .

group of young people roam the street across central athen , shout .
'' this night be for alexi ! '' .
a heavy cloud of tear gas and smoke hang over exarchia , which feel like a rebel-held enclave in a city at war .
police linger warily on its edge as young people set up burn barricade and attack government building and bank .
and clash erupt once again outside the polytechnic .
few here think the unrest will end anytime soon , and the rage of greece 's youth continue to smolder .
the death of alexandro 's have tap into anger about a range of broader complaint - about corruption , nepotism , a fail education system , and the poor economic prospects of young people , include unemployment rate in the 25 percent range .
protest be expect to continue throughout the week , with activist call for road to be block nationwide on tuesday .
they say they want to bring down greece 's whole political system - it be not just the current government that be see as tainted , most believe the main opposition be little better .
the protester , however , struggle to articulate exactly what they want in its place .
'' do not bend you head down , '' they chant as they confront police recently in front of parliament .

by the time a autopsy of the 16 - year - old be release wednesday , the tension in east flatbush could be measure in the silently flash light of squad car park at tight interval along church avenue .
for some , the sight of extra police officer mean a potential reprieve in a area trouble by crime .
for other , it be anything but reassure .
the police say that two plainclothes officer fatally shoot the teenager , kimani gray , just before 11 : 30 p . m . on saturday after he brandish a revolver and point it at they .
the police commissioner , raymond w . kelly , say tuesday that the police have interview three witness , '' two of which say that the officer say , ` don '' t move . '' '' .
'' another witness say a officer say , ` freeze , '' '' he say .
the officer then fire 11 shot , the police say .
seven bullet hit mr . gray , include three that enter he body from the rear , accord to the new york city office of the chief medical examiner .
the autopsy do not establish the order in which the bullet strike mr . gray , or determine the path of the bullet , which might make clearer if mr . gray have he back to the officer when he be shoot , or if he have twist away after be strike from the front .
but the finding , inconclusive though they be , appear likely to heighten the tension of a community already distrustful of the police and increasingly incensed about the shooting of the teenager .
on wednesday night , about 200 people attend the vigil .
the gathering become unruly when about half of they splintered off and march to a nearby police precinct station house .
after officer in riot gear set up a roadblock on church avenue , mr . gray '' s sister mahnefah try to cross the street and be put into a police car .
she be give a summons and release .
some of the protester shout , '' that '' be the sister , '' then start throw bottle when the police would not release she .
someone hurl a chair .
scream could be hear as skirmish break out on side street .
for local resident , many of whom voice skepticism about the official account , the situation surround mr . gray '' s death be grimly familiar .
less than a year before , and only block away , a narcotic detective shot and kill a unarmed 23 - year - old woman , shantel davis , as she try to flee the police in a car that have be report steal at gunpoint , the police say at the time .
vigil follow that shooting as well .
but soon the rhythm of daily life return , mark by what young man and woman say be a daily backbeat of police stop .
'' you try to put it out of you mind , '' say m . davis '' s sister crystal .
in interview around east flatbush , many speak of a police department that , in its aggressive pursuit of gang and informal criminal crew , have sow distrust , especially among young man and woman , who feel that they encounter with officer often have racial overtone .
at a barbershop along church avenue , two man on tuesday be discuss the recent shooting when a asian delivery cyclist pull onto the sidewalk across the street .
'' see that guy ? '' say elverton thoma , 39 , a black man and telemarketer who be there for a haircut .
'' he can ride on the sidewalk .
we can '' t . '' .
he barber , julian clark , also black , concur .
two year before , he say , a officer stop he in front of the shop for sidewalk ride , and then arrest he after the officer say he identification have expire ; he spend a day in custody sort it out , he say .
'' they have a hard time because there '' be a lot of crime in the neighborhood , '' he say of the police .
'' but when they play hardball , they end up go after innocent people , too . '' .
the seemingly constant presence of the police in the life of many youth -- both on the street and , increasingly , monitor conversation on social media -- have leave many feeling suffocate , say shanduke mcphatter , 35 , a ex - gang member who work with young man in the neighborhood .
'' i understand the state of mind that these youth have , '' he say .
'' the problem be there be no relationship with the police . '' .
at the same time , he say , the situation on the street have grow more complex for law enforcement : gang be less organize , replace instead by informal crew with few requirement and in which leadership be frequently up for grab among increasingly young member .
'' the police say , ` look at these kid , they '' be wild , '' '' mr . mcphatter say .
'' and then they use that as a excuse to be wild themselves . '' .
the rev . terry lee , who run a local youth ministry and act as a liaison to the police , say many of the neighborhood shooting involve '' kid kill kid '' and lament that the community do not rise up more frequently in anger over those shooting .
but he say he understand why .
'' the community we '' be live in can get dangerous at time , '' he say .
'' people be afraid of retaliation . '' .
mr . lee say the local 67th precinct have grow more open to the community in recent year .
'' the problem be , people still don '' t want to go to the police , '' he say .
the autopsy report on mr . gray do not specify which of the seven bullet cause the death of the teenager ; that determination await further investigation .
one bullet enter he left shoulder in the rear ; two other bullet strike the back of he thigh , one in the left thigh and one in the right .
two bullet strike from the front , hit he right thigh ; one bullet enter he left side , strike he lower rib cage ; and the last bullet hit he leave lower forearm .
john c . cerar , the former commander for firearm train at the police department , say many factor could explain the wound to the front and back of mr . gray '' s body .
'' most of the time , it '' be the person make a turn , or the position of the officer , '' he say , or some combination of the two .
once that person have a gun , he say , the threat to the officer be imminent .
mr . gray '' s revolver be load with four bullet , the police say .
mr . kelly , the police commissioner , say tuesday that there be '' nothing to indicate that this shooting be outside the guideline . '' .
mr . cerar concur , say , '' under the report circumstance , it appear to be a good shooting . '' .
but raw feeling in the neighborhood fuel account at wide variance with that provide by the police .
some say mr . gray , while arm , do not point the gun ; other say they have hear that there have be no gun at all , or that he hand have be in the air .
a family friend , kevin black , 33 , say he be not surprise that the autopsy have find that mr . gray have be shoot so many time or hit from behind .
he say he have speak to mr . gray '' s parent .
'' the dad be shake , '' mr . black say , stand by a makeshift memorial for mr . gray .
'' he doesn '' t sleep .
he doesn '' t talk .
he '' s still in a dream . '' .
local elect official and clergy member , seek to lower the temperature in the neighborhood , mostly do not issue new statement wednesday .
'' we focus right now be to get the funeral service together , '' say gilford t . monrose , a local pastor and community leader who be work with the family on the service ; a date have yet to be set , he say .
on tuesday , police investigator could be see inside a rite aid store where , the night before , a group of at least three dozen mostly young people briefly rampage through the aisle , turn over display and assault one customer who try to intervene .
the police release store surveillance video and later announce the arrest of a 19 - year - old , say he be one of three who hit the customer and take he cellphone .
'' nothing justify that , '' mr . kelly say .
he say at a city council hearing on tuesday that the violence have be cause by a disorderly group that break away from the vigil and do not constitute a riot , as some have term it .
'' that belittle it , '' city councilman jumaane d . william say later , refer to the community anger after the police shooting .

ellen degenere to host oscar .
august 2 , 2013 | 08 : 06am pt .
talkshow host return for second oscar tour .
and the next host of the academy award be ... ellen degenere .
it will be degenere '' second tour of duty as oscar host , have previously emcee the 79th annual academy award in 2007 and earn a emmy nomination .
the popular syndicate talkshow host also front the emmy in 2001 and 2005 -lrb- co - host they in 2003 -rrb- .
'' i be so excited to be host the oscar for the second time , '' degenere say , joke that '' you know what they say -- the third time '' be the charm . '' .
'' we be thrill to have ellen degenere host the oscar , '' say zadan and meron jointly .
'' it be a honor to welcome back ellen degenere as the host of the biggest entertainment celebration of the year , '' say abc entertainment group prexy paul lee .
over the last eight year , the 2007 oscar host by degenere stand as the top rate in both adult 18 - 49 -lrb- 14 . 1 rating / 33 share -rrb- and woman 25 - 54 -lrb- 19 . 2 / 40 -rrb- .
even as oscar organizer on friday unveil hugh jackman as the host of they gala film award , the prospect of a u.s. actor strike be cast a long shadow over whether hollywood 's big show would go on as usual .
the academy award ' february 22 date put it directly in the path of a potential walkout by screen actor guild member who vote next month on whether to give union leader permission to call a strike in stalemate contract talk with major studio .
movie making by the big studio have wind down since late june in anticipation of labor strife , compound a general slowdown from the u.s. recession .
the tension have only be heighten by fatigue from a tumultuous 14-week hollywood writer strike that end in february and cost the lo angele area economy around $ 3 billion as production stop on most prime-time tv show .
'' a strike , if one occur , would be nothing short of horrible , '' say ron howard , the former actor and oscar-winning director of '' a beautiful mind '' whose latest film , '' frost/nixon , '' be consider a strong oscar contender .
'' the timing could not be worse , '' he say on thursday .
actor leonardo dicaprio , who on thursday earn a golden globe nomination for he work in '' revolutionary road , '' say strike concern be hit '' everyone . '' .
'' it be really important that we come up with a solution , '' he say .
'' these be unheard-of time , and no one can predict what be go to happen '' with the u.s. economy .
sag 's dark cloud .
the oscar , give out by the academy of motion picture art and science , be annually hollywood 's glitziest night .
put the show in jeopardy , however , be this week 's announcement by sag that strike authorization ballot will be mail to its 120,000 member on january 2 and tally on january 23 , a full month before the oscar .
that sequence of event raise the prospect of a-list star boycott the honor to avoid cross they own union 's picket line -- or even carry picket sign themselves .
the same dynamic come into play last january when a work stoppage by 10,500 writer guild of america member throw the award season into disarray and cause the star-filled golden globe award to be replace by a news conference .
only 5.8 million tv viewer tuned-in , far below the globe ' typical 20 million audience .
broadcaster nbc lose a estimate $ 10 million to $ 15 million in advertising revenue .
the writer strike be settle a month later , spare the academy award and its network , abc , a similar fate .
but this time around , the oscar be on the firing line and australian actor jackman , star of the '' x-men '' movie as well as broadway stage show , may himself have to pull out .
'' at this point , we be move forward with all of we plan to do we show , and of course we be monitor what be go on , '' say academy spokeswoman leslie unger .
sag leader say they need a credible strike threat to wrest a better contract deal from the studio than the '' final '' offer management present before talk collapse on june 30 .
they stress , however , that a '' yes '' vote do not automatically put a strike into effect , and it remain uncertain whether sag can muster the support it need -- 75 percent of those voting -- to pass its authorization .
talk collapse over issue that include how much actor would get pay for work on the internet , and the financial impact of a possible strike on hollywood remain unclear .
most film slate for release in 2009 already have be shoot , mean the 2010 slate would see the brunt of a strike .
some tv prime-time dramas and sitcom will have complete production before sag a work stoppage , though a walkout could hinder development of new series for fall 2009 .

with any luck , a host pluck from within the movie industry 's own rank - and less emphasis on stand-up comedy , which have often be at the expense of people sit in the audience - will also play well inside the kodak theater .
in recent year the crowd of movie insider have seem to respond to host with notable coldness .
a representative for mr. jackman say he be walk a red carpet in berlin on behalf of he current film , the epic '' australia , '' and be unavailable for a interview .
deadlinehollywooddaily.com first report he selection on the web .
mr. jackman , 40 , have never be nominate for a oscar but have artistic credibility , a important credential for the m.c. of the film award show .
he have win positive review for turn in film like '' the prestige '' and '' kate and leopold . '' .
he win a tony award in 2004 for he role in the musical '' the boy from oz . '' .
he also have experience as a award show m.c. , win a emmy in 2005 for he appearance as host of the tony .
he preside over that ceremony three time .
the oscar be a very different phenomenon from the tony .
the film honor be a awkward hybrid - a telecast about the movie set in a theater - that require they host to oscillate between jocular chitchat and solemn introduction , while sprinkling in just the right amount of self-deprecation .
serve as host of the three-hour live show require physical stamina and a ability to hold up under the emotional pressure of know that the television audience , while diminish in the united state , number several hundred million worldwide .
this year mr. jackman will have the add pressure of serve as the ringmaster of a lavish self-congratulation-a-thon at a time of global economic crisis .
prepare for the job may prove difficult , since producer will most likely need to draw up contingency plan in the event of a screen actor guild strike .
the union , at loggerheads with studio over contract issue big and small , say on wednesday that it would ask its member to authorize a strike .
the union , which will announce the result of the vote in late january , see its power to wreak havoc with the oscar as prime leverage .
the telecast have come under harsh criticism in recent year as a lumber snore that take itself too seriously and lack spontaneity .
star wattage have dim , with many member of the a list refuse to attend unless they be nominate or have a come film to promote .
a trend toward honor small , independent movie that most people have not see have dent viewership .
rating for last year 's oscar plunge to a record low , with about 32 million people tuning in , compare with 55.3 million a decade ago .
mr. condon and mr. mark , who recently serve as the creative team behind the movie '' dreamgirl , '' be try to energize the telecast partly by make the ceremony more of a party that celebrate movie in general , not just the elite few select by academy voter .
'' we be still at the preliminary conversation stage about what hugh want to do , but he theatrical talent certainly do give we reason to do at least one musical number , '' mr. mark say .

jon stewart , who host in 2008 and 2006 , and ellen degenere , the 2007 host , be the latest in a line of funny emcee since 1990 .
billy crystal do it eight time , whoopi goldberg take on four , steve martin do it twice and david letterman and chris rock each have a shot .

and , excite to be work with larry and bill on what i know will be a fun and memorable celebration . '' .
have a entertainer such as jackman host the show necessitate a change in the well-established standard of open the show with a joke , say steve pond , author of the 2005 book '' the big show : high time and dirty dealings backstage at the academy award . '' .

the grammy award spice up its nomination earlier this month by trade its typical staid press conference for a glitzy , live concert special .
ratings-wise , the hourlong show come in fourth among prime-time contender , behind such dramas as nbc 's '' life '' and abc 's '' private practice . '' .
bring in jackman to host the academy award be '' a stretch for the oscar , but at this stage , it be worth take the risk , '' pond say .

the actor , who also star in the three '' x-men '' movie and be a award-winning musical theater performer , have host broadway 's tony award three time and last month be name 2008 's '' sexiest man alive '' by people magazine .
'' hugh jackman be a consummate entertainer and a internationally renowned movie star , '' say laurence mark and bill condon , the new producer of the televise show .
'' he also have style , elegance and a sense of occasion .
hugh be the ideal choice to host a celebration of the year 's movie -- and to have fun do it , '' the pair say in a statement .
oscar nomination for the best movie and performance of 2008 will be announce in january .
the award will be hand out on february 22 by the academy at the kodak theater in hollywood and will be televise in the united state by the abc network .
jackman 's choice herald a new direction for the 81st oscar ceremony after recent year of fall tv rating .
typically , the program have be host by u.s. comedian , and in recent year , show organizer have experiment with a variety of host style range from political satirist jon stewart , to edgy chris rock and popular ellen degenere .
mark and condon have ax the famous opening monologue for the february 2009 show , hope for more spontaneity overall .
they say there may be a stronger element of music and dancing than previously .
'' we want it to be more of a party and a celebration and a departure from the late-night talk-show format , '' mark tell reuter .
mark and condon have a background in musical and work together on the 2006 film hit '' dreamgirl '' .
jackman , who can sing and dance , be '' genuinely thrill '' at the offer , mark say , but '' he want to make sure the format would mesh with he skill . '' .
the february 2008 three-hour plus broadcast , host for the second time by stewart , hit a low 32 million u.s. viewer and enter the record book as the least-watched oscar ever .
still , even a audience of that size make the telecast annually one of the most-watched u.s. tv show .
the broadcast also be televise live in more than 200 country worldwide .
mark say he and condon plan to get the telecast under three hour , yet still keep the live presentation of award and acceptance speech .
ellen degenere set as oscar host for 2014 academy award .
post : 08 / 02 / 2013 11 : 10 be edt .
ellen degenere will host the oscar .
the comedian and talk show host make the announcement via she twitter feed on friday .
degenere have experience host the academy award : she previously serve as emcee during the 2007 ceremony .
i be so excited to be host the oscar for the second time , '' degenere say in a press release announce the big news .
that degenere be choose as host should please critic who be unhappy with this year master of ceremony , seth macfarlane .
if only he will wear those gold lame pants .
as word get out friday that hugh jackman will be this year 's oscar host , a clip from the 2004 tony telecast of he performance from '' the boy from oz '' make the round .
if you happen to miss the 2004 tony , jackman , play the flamboyant australian songwriter peter allen , sing , dance and writhe he way across the stage in a leopard skin top and skin-tight gold lame pants .
will the oscar gift basket include smell salt ?
jackman , who have host the tony several time and win a emmy for do so in 2005 , certainly know how to hold a stage -- he win a tony for '' the boy from oz '' -- and by choose he , first-time oscar producer laurence mark and bill condon be bet that broadway can do what comedy could not .
previous host -- jon stewart , ellen degenere , chri rock -- all follow the traditional stand-up model and the rating have steadily sour .
obviously a change be require , and though i would lean toward think '' television '' rather than '' broadway '' -lrb- why , i even write a piece about it , for this come sunday 's calendar , before the host choice be announce -rrb- , jackman be , of course , another way to go .
clearly mark and condon be less concern with solve the rating crisis as they be with create a new vibe for the show .
jackman may have more talent in he little finger than most of we do in we entire body , but he do not have the fan base of degenere or rock .
if you be among the thousand who love he host of the tony , you be probably not only watch the oscar anyway , you be host you own annual oscar party .
yes , jackman be just name people 's sexiest man alive , and yes , he be wolverine of '' x-men '' but do we want wolverine host the oscar ?
probably not .
otherwise , jackman 's movie career have be less than memorable , cap by this year 's box office dud '' australia . '' .
and as last season 's mercifully short-lived '' viva laughlin '' prove , one talented person do not a television show make .
or at least not a good television show .
but mark and condon be the team that bring we '' dreamgirl , '' which actually make jackman a obvious choice .
there be nothing wrong with a big broadway-esque opener similar to billy crystal 's famous musical clip , but with more hip action .
beyond that , however , it get a little worrisome .
the oscar have a prickly relationship with singin ' and dancin ' and as anyone who see rosie o'donnell 's recent disaster know , nothing fail bigger than a fail variety show .
what jackman do have in he favor be a unapologetic , unabashed love for , and understanding of , theater .
he be not snarky and he be not a outsider .
he be a from-the-bottom-of-his-heart performer who seem utterly happy and at ease in front of a audience .
no doubt those in the kodak will enjoy a energetic and dazzling evening .
how it will play on television remain to be see .
but maybe it be time we stop care about that so much .

'' we want to take the show to another form , '' mark say .
'' hugh seem to be the perfect person .
the lovely thing about the show be it be a tv show set in a theater about the movie , so the fact that he be a movie star ... he be also a extraordinary stage presence and he do actually have a emmy award for host the tony .

ellen degenere return to host the oscar .
post august 2nd , 2013 at 5 : 19 pm .
television icon ellen degenere will return to host the oscar for a second time , producer craig zadan and neil meron announce today .
'' we be thrill to have ellen degenere host the oscar , '' say zadan and meron .
'' i be so excited to be host the oscar for the second time .
you know what they say - the third time the charm , '' say degenere .
'' i agree with craig and neil immediately that ellen be the ideal host for this year '' s show , '' say cheryl boone isaac , academy president .
'' it be a honor to welcome back ellen degenere as the host of the biggest entertainment celebration of the year , '' say paul lee , president , abc entertainment group .
we very much look forward to have she back on abc for oscar sunday . '' .
degenere host the 79th academy award in 2007 , for which she receive a primetime emmy nomination for '' outstanding individual performance in a variety or music program . '' .
now that it be be confirm that hugh jackman will be host the 81st annual academy award , instantly up the annual ceremony 's overall attractiveness , the ampersand would like to offer some heartfelt advice to the first-time oscar host .
true , jackman hold he own just fine as the host of both the 2004 and 2005 tony award , earn a emmy for the former , but this be a whole new ballgame .
so without further ado , hugh , a list of do and n't when host the academy award .
do keep joke tight , snappy and to-the-point , a la jon stewart .
stewart pull off a television miracle last year when he host the 2007 oscar only 11 day after the wga writer 's strike end , mean that he joke and open speech be last-minute write .
this do not seem to dampen stewart 's usual comedic flair .
keep a constant string of quick -lrb- and often political -rrb- one-liner come at the audience , who have to keep on they toe so as not to miss anything , he make sure that the ceremony do not get bog down , keep thing lively .
my personal favourite quip .
'' oscar be 80 this year , which make he now automatically the front-runner for the republican nomination . '' .
a '' john mccain be so old '' joke be never in bad taste !
stewart also ooze confidence , despite lackluster review of he host job in 2006 .
do channel johnny carson .
carson be consider the epitome of the oscar host .
he host the ceremony five time and find that magical place where a joke be just bite enough , but do not sting .
'' i see some new face here , especially on the old one , '' he joke in one opening speech .
see ?
slightly scathing , but playful .
after all , the last thing you want to do be piss off you entire industry .
do allow yourself to get star-struck .
even the hollywood heavy-weight that host the oscar be allow to be overwhelm by the folk the statuette be be present to .
while obviously a part of she act , there be something very endearing about ellen degenere pause in she host spiel to snap a myspace picture of she and clint eastwood and let the audience know what a thrill the experience of host for they be .
nothing 's go to get the audience on you side like admit they they impress you .
do go big .
hollywood have never be about self-restraint or simplicity .
when celebrate the movie industry you have get to be lavish .
while jackman have a certain compose air about he and ooze class -lrb- have you see a picture of he in a tux ? -rrb- he could benefit from a spectacular entrance like whoopi goldberg 's in 1999 -lrb- she waltz on stage in full queen elizabeth get-up -rrb- .
it be hollywood : go big , baby .
do watch the time .
since the introduction of the play-off music that cut award recipient off when they get too long-winded -lrb- be there anything more embarrassing than watch a a-lister chase the microphone as its lower into the stage in order to get that last thank-you in ? -rrb- , the oscar have be trimmer in recent year .
but just as dangerous as the ceremony go over be it run short .
it happen in 1959 .
then host jerry lewis force that year 's winner to dance awkwardly around the stage in order to fill the last twenty minute of he broadcast .
mortify .
avoid at all cost .
do not appropriate .
it will always be funny when billy crystal relive the year 's greatest film -lrb- or rather , dodge certain death within they -rrb- in a intricate opening montage .
he be do it eight time already and it have yet to get old .
that be say , it be crystal 's thing .
jackman will have to come up with he own trademark host quirk .
might i suggest flashy , high-kicking song and dance number ?
do not do anything that david letterman do .
enough say .
do not be afraid to be abusive or controversial .
while no one ever want to see a repeat of michael moore 's rant in 2001 , it be the snippy , daring joke and comment that be remembered , like steve martin 's improvistation right after the aforementioned tirade .

however , he do have three of he four touchdown in that stretch .
fullback mike karney have receive five utilization in the last two week , though most be on short-yardage situation .
fantasy owner carry bush have almost certainly miss out on thoma ; .
if for some reason he be available , pick he up immediately .
mcallister be a last-ditch flex option as the saint face the detroit lion in week 16 , but play he be a risk give thoma ' versatility .
karney be not a viable fantasy back .

when the saint -lrb- 11 - 5 -rrb- open the playoff in seattle -lrb- 7 - 9 -rrb- on saturday , the only remain healthy run back from they regular season roster will be reggie bush and julius jone .
naturally , be go to have to step up , '' bush say .
bush miss eight game with a fracture in he lower right leg .
he have rush for only 150 yard and have not score a rush touchdown this season , but start to look stronger on sunday against tampa bay , when he have 70 yard rush on just nine carry and have 55 yard receive on five catch .
jone have 193 yard and no touchdown on the ground .
the only other run back on the roster be fourth - year pro deshawn wynn , who be sign on tuesday but also be with the saint during the preseason , and rookie joique bell , who be sign wednesday from the philadelphia eagle practice squad .
bree say he remain optimistic that the versatility of the saint offense and the way they spread the ball among so many player will allow they to weather such injury perhaps better than most team .
in the end , you just work to the strength of the guy that you have .
you not worry about what you not have , just what you have , '' bree say .
while you would love to have all of the guy and all of the element that they bring , i feel like reggie bush can do some pretty special stuff and julius jone can do some pretty special stuff .
deshawn wynn , when call upon , can do the job .
you realize that the passing game may have to pick up some slack at time depend on how the game plan change by have those guy in . '' .
bush , who return from he broken right fibula on thanksgiving , say he have be feel stronger lately and be look forward to the chance to be the primary run back .
however , he stress that the success of the offense would hinge on many more factor than he .
it about a team effort .
it not just about one person , '' bush say .
we have some mistake that we make as a team throughout the season on offense , defense and special team that have get to clean up .
the run back position be just one small piece of the puzzle . '' .
yet as the playoff approach , the saint have be optimistic they offense would be better with thoma , who score memorable touchdown in both the nfc title game and super bowl last season .
plague by a left ankle injury that limit he to only six game this season , thomas start to look effective again in a 17 - 14 victory at atlanta in week 16 , when he have 102 yard from scrimmage and a touchdown .
however , he aggravate the injury in practice last week and sit out the regular season finale .
the setback he have be substantial and be at that point in the season where you want to do what best , and yet you want to be mindful of the injury the player have , '' saint coach sean payton say .
so i think on all front - - doctor , trainer , the player and ourselves - - we feel that this be the best move . '' .
thomas initially be hurt in a overtime loss to atlanta in week 3 , then miss nine game before come back for three late - season game .
he finish with 269 yard and two touchdown rush and catch 29 pass for 201 yard .
late this season , thoma also have handle kickoff return after courtney roby be place on injured reserve with a head injury .
payton say receiver devery henderson and robert meachem be get most of the practice time in that area this week .
ivory injury be a lisfranc , which be a fracture and dislocation in the mid - foot , and will require surgery , payton say .
after join the saint as a undrafted rookie out of division ii tiffin , he rush for 716 yard in 12 game and have a team - lead five rush td .
the new orlean saint place reggie bush on injured reserve today , officially end he third nfl season .
it be the second straight year that bush fail to make it to the last week of the season .
it be also the second straight year that bush take step backward after a strong rookie season .
bush , who miss several game after arthroscopic knee surgery earlier this season , wrap up the year with 404 yard rush and 440 yard receive .
he score six touchdown on offense and add three more on punt return .
there be nothing wrong with nine touchdown in 10 game , but bush 's inability to stay on the field have make he something less than the saint expect with the second overall pick in the 2006 draft .
leon washington of the jet , a fourth-rounder that year , have turn in similar production as bush this season -lrb- in more game -rrb- but cost he team much less money .
make matter worse be the fact that the relationship between bush and coach sean payton seem to be deteriorate .
bush express unhappiness about be yank from last week 's loss to the bear , two week after payton make a similar move against the buc .
whatever he shortcoming , bush could still play a important role in the supercharged saint offense .
unless he lose payton 's faith once and for all , of course .
reggie bush be do , for the season at least .
bush sprain the medial collateral ligament in he left knee in the saint ' game against the chicago bear thursday night .
he originally injure it against the carolina panther earlier this season and need surgery on it .

accord to both microsoft and numerous security firm , attack have be mount , particularly since last weekend , when hacker begin hijack legitimate web site and launch exploit against unwary visitor .
in fact , microsoft say it monitor a '' huge increase '' in attack last saturday .
the number of infected web site , many of they legitimate , have grow at '' a alarming '' rate since the vulnerability be release into the wild and people need to do nothing but visit a infected site with a vulnerable browser to be affect .
by friday , microsoft be aware user be become infected at a rate even faster than previous zero-day exploit .
originally porn site seem to be the carrier , but the number of legit site cause infection be skyrocket .
hacker be plant the exploit use well-known sql injection technique .
it be user ' turn to protect themselves by install this emergency patch and all all the other , and fast .
since the bad guy be exploit it before microsoft know it exist , the exploit be term '' zero day '' because that be how much notice microsoft get of the problem .
it be also term a '' drive-by '' exploit since a user could pick up a malware infestation by merely use ie to browse any of thousand of compromise website .
in short , it be really nasty stuff .
brian kreb sound worried .
microsoft estimate monday that one in every 500 window user have be expose to site that try to exploit the flaw .
additionally , it say the number of victim be increase at a rate of 50 percent daily .
this be a urgent update .
if you use window , apply this patch now .
microsoft 's mike reavey grab the mic .
this update will be apply automatically to hundred of million of customer through automatic update over the next few day .
and , for we enterprise customer - with multiple system within they network - this update can be deploy through all standard security update management system include , sccm , sms , wsus , and window update .
this update meet the quality , deployment and application compatibility criterion .
it be a high-quality update , ready for broad release , and we encourage customer to test and deploy this update as quickly as possible .
we be able to share detailed information with we partner in the microsoft active protection program -lrb- mapp -rrb- and microsoft security response alliance -lrb- msra -rrb- , allow protection to be create for over 24 different security partner ' product .
this be further validation of we commitment to community base defense ' and mean customer that ... be not even use microsoft product , be also protect from know attack .
ed oswald be impress by microsoft 's speed .
well , that be quick .
it be pretty bad when security expert be tell you customer to switch .
these be unbiased -lrb- for the most part -rrb- folk , and the typical computer user be go to take they advice seriously .
but tiny dancer ... well , not so much .
eight day be rather shamefully long to have to wait for a potentially devastating vulnerability to be fix .
this be not hanukkah , microsoft , and you be not no maccabee .
hacker exploit critical ie bug ; microsoft promise patch .
ie6 through ie11 harbor vulnerability , but in - the - wild attack limit to ie8 and ie9 .
september 17 , 2013 03 : 16 pm et .
computerworld - microsoft today say that hacker be exploit a critical , but unpatched , vulnerability in internet explorer 8 -lrb- ie8 -rrb- and internet explorer 9 -lrb- ie9 -rrb- , and that its engineer be work on a update to plug the hole .
as it often do , the company downplay the threat .
there be only report of a limited number of target attack specifically direct at internet explorer 8 and 9 , although the issue could potentially affect all support version , '' dustin child , a manager in the trustworthy computing group and its usual spokesman , say in a blog post tuesday morning .
we be actively work to develop a security update to address this issue , '' child add .
accord to child and the security advisory microsoft also publish today , the vulnerability affect all support version of ie , from the 12 - year - old ie6 to the not - yet - officially - release ie11 , the browser that will accompany window 8 . 1 when it ship oct . 18 .
there be no escape this one , '' say andrew storm , director of devop at cloud security vendor cloudpassage , refer to the bug affect all version of microsoft browser .
ie zero - day be never a good thing , especially when they affect every version , '' storm add .
although microsoft advisory do not put it in these term , the vulnerability can be exploit use classic drive - by attack tactic .
that mean hacker need only lure victim run ie to malicious site - - or legitimate website that have previously be compromise and load with attack code - - to hijack they browser and plant malware on they window pc .
until microsoft produce a patch , the company offer customer several option to protect themselves , include advice on configure emet 4 . 0 and run one of its fixit automate tool to shim the dll that contain the ie render engine .
emet -lrb- enhance mitigation experience toolkit -rrb- be a tool design for advanced user , primarily enterprise it professional , that manually enable anti - exploit technology such as aslr -lrb- address space layout randomization -rrb- and dep -lrb- datum execution prevention -rrb- for specific application .
but the fixit route will be easiest for individual user : microsoft post a link to the fixit tool on its support site , and customer need only click the icon mark enable . '' .
microsoft have use the shim approach before when face with unexpected attack against ie .
base on past practice , microsoft fixit workaround probably use the application compatibility toolkit to modify the core library of ie - - a dll -lrb- dynamic link library -rrb- name mshtml . dll that contain the browser render engine - - in memory each time ie run .
the shim do not quash the bug , but instead make the browser immune to the attack microsoft see in the wild thus far .
user can also temporarily ditch ie for a alternate browser , such as google chrome or mozilla firefox , to stay safe until microsoft come up with a permanent fix .
microsoft today decline say when it plan to patch the ie vulnerability .
but because the next regularly - schedule patch tuesday be three week away , it possible the redmond , wash . company security team will deliver a so - call out - of - band update before oct . 9 .
out - of - band update from microsoft be rare : the last one it ship be ms13 - 008 , a the emergency patch issue jan . 14 that plug a hole in ie6 , ie7 and ie8 that have be exploit since early december 2012 .

there be at least six distinct version of attack code circulate in the wild , accord to researcher at idefense , a security lab own by verisign .
a web search show 233,000 page contain the string ardoshanghai.com/s.js , just one of many web address exploit a weakness in the way ie 's data-binding function work .
most of the attack silently install keylogging software as soon as a victim surf to a site carry the exploit .
once install , the software steal login credentials for online game .
attack string in separate sql injection include 17gamo .
researcher say the number of attack site be too high to keep exhaustive list , but shadowserver be do a admirable job here .
'' the vulnerability be so juicy that we expect it to show up in tool kit fairly shortly , '' say rick howard , intelligence director of idefense .
the patch be release eight day after report begin circulate that website be target a vulnerability in fully patch version of ie .
this be only the second time in 18 month that microsoft have issue a unscheduled update .
typically , patch be available on the second tuesday of each month to allow system administrator time for planning .
give the prevalence of attack , there be no good reason why anyone run a window machine should not stop what they be do and install the patch immediately -lrb- those with administrative rights , anyway -rrb- - do so be as easy as open ie and select window update from the tool menu .

'' the bad news be that this be a very wide - reach patch , affect all version of ie across all operate system , from xp to rt , '' he say .
and more bad news : the average user be very susceptible to be hit with this . '' .
microsoft claim that run internet explorer in enhance security configuration mode prevent this attack .
internet explorer run in this restricted mode by default on window server 2008 , window server 2008 r2 , window server 2012 , and window server 2012 r2 .
microsoft state that all support version of outlook , outlook express , and window mail include protection by default as well .
html email message be open by default in the restricted site security zone , which disable script and activex control necessary for the exploit to execute .
however , microsoft caution that the protection in outlook only apply to the html message within outlook itself .
if a user receive a email with a link and click on it , they '' be still potentially vulnerable because the threat be now web - base and function outside of outlook .
'' the average user do not run the restricted site mode , be not use the enhance security configuration and be all - too - willing to click on phishing email , '' henry explain , i recommend employ the mitigating factor , as well as advise user about this so they will be less likely to click malicious link until you can apply the patch .
it '' be be a while since we '' ve see a out - of - band patch for ie from microsoft , but it '' s still important to apply it as soon as possible . '' .
'' it important to reiterate that all version of ie be affect include the internet explorer 11 preview , tyler reguly , technical manager of security research and development for tripwire , say .
since attack be occur now , this be a situation where it in everyone best interest for microsoft to release a patch as soon as possible .
in the meantime , install the shim that they release . '' .
he add , '' for less technical user that be comfortable with microsoft fix it solution , use another browser until a patch be available be the best option , '' .
a couple additional note : the fix - it solution only work with 32 - bit version of internet explorer , and you must first apply the cumulative update for internet explorer from last week '' s patch tuesday -lrb- ms13 - 069 -rrb- .

the pass yesterday of w. mark feel , the man who be the infamous secret source for washington post reporter bob woodward and carl bernstein during they investigation of the watergate scandal , mark the end of a life that bring about both the good and the bad of anonymous source in political journalism .
without feel 's information , the full scale of the nixon administration 's corruption would likely never have come to light , he would not have resign in disgrace , and it might have set a precedent that the president of the united state be above the law .
deep throat also give we a new archetype in popular culture : the shadowy insider in a trench coat , call up reporter for secret meeting in parking garage to spill the dirt , often with gravely voice and cautious look over the shoulder .
it be be employ in entertainment ever since , from hal holbrook 's performance as deep throat in all the president 's man , to fox mulder 's informant in the x-files , to even the caped crusader give vickus vale the cure for the joker 's poison gas in batman .
but the downside of feel 's legacy be the increase willingness of modern day journalist to grant anonymity to source at the drop of a fedora .
i have be a avid reader of political news for ten year now and lose count of how many story be attribute to someone , '' who decline to be name because they be not authorize to speak on the matter , '' or , '' who decline to be name for fear of anger the president . '' .
it be become a lazy reporter 's default set to allow people to talk on '' deep background , '' and as a result we have slip into a rut where accountability in government have become a rare , almost non-existent concept .
all journalist should pore over the many obit of feel today and think long and hard about they duty to the public the next time someone ask to go off the record .

with a clinched playoff berth , the colt can focus on how they will match up against a playoff - caliber team before wildcard weekend .
chief lose 20 - 13 to colt despite charle '' 226 yard rush .
december 23 , 2012 .
on a day when the kansa city chief rush for the 3rd - most yard in franchise history and the defense play well for 55 minute of the game , the chief lose to the indianapolis colt , 20 - 13 , and keep they grip on the # pick in the 2013 nfl draft .
by beat the chief , indianapolis '' record rise to 9 - 5 and they lock up a playoff spot just one season after post the worst record in the nfl in 2011 -- a chief - like 2 - 14 mark .
meanwhile , the chief lose they 13th game of the season and could tie the franchise mark of 14 loss next week in denver against peyton manning and the bronco .
the 2008 chief end the season with a 2 - 14 record .
on the only positive note for the game , the chief have two player rush for over 100 yard apiece something that hasn '' t happen to the franchise since 1991 .
jamaal charle -lrb- 226 yard -rrb- and peyton hillis -lrb- 101 yard -rrb- lead a powerful attack that , for any team other than the 2012 chief , would have nearly guarantee a victory .
kc end the game with 352 net yard rush .
the 1961 dalla texan rush for 398 yard against houston -lrb- 10 / 1 / 61 -rrb- and the '' 66 squad gain 380 yard rush against denver -lrb- 10 / 23 / 66 -rrb- .
but this year '' s team be undo again by three turnover , a miss field goal , and untimely penalty that wipe out score drive .
brady quinn throw two interception , both of which have a devastating effect on the chief .
the first occur on kansa city '' s open drive when quinn throw behind receiver dexter mccluster and colt cornerback , darius butler , pick it off and return it 32 yard for a touchdown , put indy up 7 - 0 .
quinn '' s second interception of the game come at a crucial point in the 4th quarter with the team trail 13 - 10 and with the ball at the indy 14 - yard line .
quinn underthrew a pass in the end zone to receiver jon baldwin and be pick off by vontae davis for a indianapolis touchback .
yet another potential score opportunity blow for the chief .
quinn throw a third interception -- and he second to davi in consecutive series -- but it be overturn when davis be call for pass interference .
any honest chief fan would say that it be the most '' phantom '' interference penalty ever as davis never appear to touch kc receiver jamar newsome .
kicker ryan succop show he jekyll / hyde nature in the first quarter by nail a 47 - yard field goal that look good the moment he kick it , but then miss a 43 - yarder that would have make the score 7 - 6 .
towards the end of the first half , charle make he only mistake of the day by fumble at the indianapolis 16 - yard line , snuff out another score opportunity with the chief behind 10 - 3 .
the colt turn the fumble into another field goal and go into halftime lead kc , 13 - 3 .
as the second half open , the chief look like they be go to go into self - destruct mode again when return man , devon wylie , inexplicably try to return the second - half kickoff from deep in he own end zone and be swarm under at the 14 - yard line by indy .
the few chief fan remain in the stand undoubtedly think about go home early and get a head start on dinner .
-lrb- personal note : somebody on the special team '' coaching staff need to put leg chain on wylie , who apparently think he be former all - pro return man , dante hall .
wylie bring out every kick and more often than not , doesn '' t get the ball back to the 20 - yard line . -rrb- .
but , show why he be the best player on the team , charle take a handoff around the left end and with some terrific downfield block by baldwin , romp 86 yard for the chief first touchdown in nine quarter of football -- ironically since charle '' 80 - yard td run on the opening play of the cleveland game two week ago .
colt -- 13 , chief -- 10 and a new ballgame .
both defens tighten up in the second half , but the key play of the game come with 10 minute leave in the fourth quarter and the score tie 13 - 13 .
the chief face a 4th - and - inch at the indy 27 - yd line , but despite have hillis and charle in the backfield , coach romeo crennel and offensive coordinator brian daboll decide to have quinn try a quarterback sneak .
quinn be stop short and the colt take the ball over on downs .
it be here that chief fan could see what might have be have they have this awful season last year when colt qb andrew luck be the top prize of the draft .
luck have struggle all day long under pressure from the chief defense and the rookie look very ordinary .
however , when it count , he look like joe montana .
luck calmly lead the colt on a 13 - play drive that culminate in a laser - like td throw to reggie wayne that put the colt up 20 - 13 .
i say that chief fan could only dream of have luck because if there be ever a indictment of the chief qb situation , it come on the next series of downs .
with four minute leave in the game , wylie again bring the kick - off out of the end zone and be tackle at the 10 - yard line .
-lrb- seriously ... somebody cut he now . -rrb- .
with 90 yard to go and two time out -lrb- plus the two - minute warning -rrb- in they pocket the chief put a big red ribbon on this turd of a season for fan by run the follow '' game - win '' play .
1st - and - 10 -- quinn pass incomplete short right to steve maneri .
2nd - and - 10 -- jamaal charle up middle for 2 yard .
3rd - and - 8 -- -lrb- shotgun formation -rrb- peyton hilli around right end for - 2 yard .
4th - and - 10 -- dustin colquitt punt .
so on a day when at least nine nfl quarterback throw for 300 yard or more -lrb- and three throw for 400 -rrb- , the chief wouldn '' t let they # quarterback attempt to win a game with he arm .
one could only assume it '' s because the odds of jamaal charle rip off another 90 - yard run be more likely than any of the stiff play qb for the chief lead a game - win drive .
then , like the grinch that really want to screw the fan holiday , the defense couldn '' t stop the colt offense as indy easily pick up a first down and run out the clock .
luckily for kc fan , the final indignity of the season will end next week when the free agent qb that infamously spurn the chief , peyton manning , lead he 12 - 3 bronco against kc in what may be romeo crennel and scott piolus '' be last game with the chief .
man and the bronco have a legitimate shot at get the # seed in the afc for the playoff , so they not be rest anyone for the last game .
well , at least not until denver be up by four touchdown , which may be halftime .
chief lose 20 - 13 to a fourth quarter indianapolis colt stampede .
sunday 23 dec 2012 .
the kansa city chief lose possibly the best game they '' ve play this season .
they lose to a fourth quarter colt stampede 20 - 13 .
this time it be coach romeo crennel '' s fault .
there they be on the colt 27 - yard line with inch to go for a first down and crennel decide to go for it .
he should have play it safe with a field goal .
they blow it on a quarterback sneak .
the score be tie 13 - 13 .
they hand the ball over to the colt at the 27 - yard line and the colt take it back down the field for a fourth quarter touchdown and win the game .
this be a game that see a great performance by they run back jamaal charle and former razorback peyton hillis .
charle turn in a 86 - yard touchdown run and rush for a total of 226 yard and hillis rush for more than a hundred yard .
put it all together and the chief gain 507 yard and still manage -- through penalty , interception and fumble -- to lose the game .
astounding !
this give the colt a 9 - 5 season and eligibility for the playoff .
i guess it '' be possible to put together a team that so consistently shoot itself in the foot , but the chief be a incredible collection of screwup with a few brilliant player who come out every week and make it look like it might be a football team .
but be usually thwart by the goofup ; some must come off that field shake they head and fondering in frustration .
this be the chief '' last home game of the season , and it would have be nice if they could have win it .
oh well , next week they journey to denver to take on the bronco in they mile high city with they rarified air .
denver be not go to be a pushover .
the bronco be 12 - 3 for the season after defeat the cleveland brown 34 - 12 sunday .
denver be up for the number one seed and the chief down in the basement with a 2 - 13 season .
hope spring eternal ... ... ... ...

on dec 23 2012 , 5 : 03p .
andrew luck wield he fourth quarter magic wand yet again , willing colt to victory over hapless chief and into the 2012 playoff !
what a remarkable story .
too bad the game that put the 2012 indianapolis colt into the playoff be such a dud .
but , a win be a win , and prior to the start of the 2012 regular season , very few -lrb- if any ! -rrb- people have the colt win ten game and earn a post - season birth .
on sunday , in they week 16 match - up with a kansas city team some thought would be a playoff contender in 2012 , the colt take care of business and dispatch the chief 20 - 13 .
the key to the game be -lrb- drrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrum roll ... ... ... -rrb- turnover !
kansas city have several .
the colt have zilcho .
two brady quinn interception and a boneheaded fumble by jamaal charle be what win this game for the colt .
that , and some fourth quarter heroics by the offense , but mostly it be kc just be really , really bad .
for the second time this season , darius butler pick off a pass and return it for a td .
in this game , he do it on kc opening driving , scoop the ball off the turf and scampering in from 32 yard out to give the colt a 7 - 0 lead .
unfortunately , the colt offense simply could not sustain drive .
drop pass -lrb- i count three -rrb- be the bane of indy offense early on .
because drive could not be sustain , the chief begin to gash the colt in the run game .
kc blast indy with 352 net rush yard .
three hundred and fifty two !
jesus h . christ !
still , to further illustrate to you , we well - inform reader , how run the football be nearly meaningless in this league , the chief never lead in this game despite run all over a extremely porous and injured colt defense .
part of the reason kc run so effectively be the awful play of pat angerer , how should so obviously be on ir right now it not even funny .
he redeem himself a bit by force a critical fumble late in the second quarter , but that play be mostly the fumble - prone jamaal charle -lrb- 3 on the season -rrb- be careless with the ball .
still , despite three turnover , kc manage to tie the game go itno the fourth .
then , as he have do so many time this year , andrew luck wield he magic wand and will the colt to victory .
the colt offense go on a 13 - play drive start at they own 27 , eat up 6 : 05 of the clock , and cap it off with a 7 - yard touchdown pass from luck to -lrb- who else -rrb- reggie wayne .
ballgame .
20 - 13 .

colt clinch playoff spot with 20 - 13 win over chief .
on dec 23 2012 , 6 : 11p .
the indianapolis colt clinch a playoff spot and the five seed in the afc playoff with a 20 - 13 win over the kansas city chief on another andrew luck game - win drive , he seventh of the season .
a year ago , the indianapolis colt be a nfl - worst 2 - 14 and do not figure to be much better this season .
but fifteen game later and the colt stand at 10 - 5 and in the playoff as the afc five seed .
it be the representation of a incredible sesaon that will be extend beyond just next week .
the colt get the win today , but it be pretty .
in fact , accord to pro football reference , it be the first time in nfl history that a team rush for over 350 yard and lose the game .
the colt be outplay on both side of the ball , but when it count andrew luck and the colt get it do .
check out some note from the game .
andrew luck be terrible for a stretch in the game that include 10 straight incompletion .
but after that he get hot at just the right time and hit he last 6 pass of the day , cap off by a 7 - yard touchdown pass to reggie wayne in the back of the end zone for what prove to be the game win score with four minute leave .
he end the day 17 / 35 for 205 yard and the touchdown along with 6 carry for 21 yard .
for the second week in a row he do not turn the ball over , which be huge .
and he also set the nfl rookie record for most pass yard in a season with 4 , 051 yard - break cam newton record set a year ago .
dwayne allen also set a colt rookie record for reception by a tight end with 43 .
allen have have a tremendous rookie year .
he have a bright future ahead of he .
cassius vaughn and pat angerer both be terrible today .
there be other as well , but those two be the one that really stick out .
basically , however , the whole defense stink today .
the colt give up 507 total yard , 352 of they on the ground .
it be the worst run defense i have see the colt play since that now infamous debacle in jacksonville in 2006 .
simply must improve .
that say , the colt win the turnover battle 3 - 0 over the chief .
darius butler pick off a terrible brady quinn throw and take it back 32 yard for a score .
it be butler 4th pick of the year and the 2nd one he return for a touchdown .
pat angerer also force a big fumble with the chief in the red zone and threaten that lead to 3 point for the colt before the half .
and then the 3rd turnover be a pick by vontae davis .
when you have a +3 turnover differential , you be go to win most game .
it will be huge if the colt could keep that up .
the wide receiver really do help out andrew luck today .
they drop several pass -lrb- reggie wayne include -rrb- and fail to get open numerous other time .
while it look like a bad game from luck , i place more of the blame on the receiver in this one .
nothing be open .
however , on the final drive , once reggie wayne start get involve , the colt start roll .
on the last drive he catch 3 pass for 37 yard and a touchdown .
prior to that he have catch 2 pass for 44 .
the key be that once the colt get reggie involve , good thing happen .
this game be andrew luck 7th game - win drive of the season , tie a nfl record - not just a rookie record .
peyton manning do it twice .
incredibly , if luck lead a game win drive next week in a very winnable game for the colt , he would have the nfl record all to himself - as a rookie .
add to that fact be that the colt be 8 - 1 in game decide by one score or less - the only loss come in week 3 on that last - minute 80 yard touchdown pass by the jaguar after luck have lead another go - ahead score drive late in the 4th quarter .
chuck pagano return tomorrow .
what a moment that will be tomorrow when pagano walk into the locker room and be hand the head coaching reign once again .
and what a moment that will be next sunday when he take the field for the first time since week 3 .
colt nation have support he all the way , as have the nfl .
next sunday , the division rival houston texan come to luca oil stadium have never win in indy .
this be a game that before the season i even think the colt would win - back when i think they would get 7 win all year .
they can beat the texan , and with pagano come back , that will be a special game .
great job , bruce arian .
tremendous .
now my piece of advice to the colt - not stop be chuckstrong .
pagano certainly not .
harrison out against jaguar .
indianapolis colt wide receiver marvin harrison do not play in thursday night 's 31-24 win over jacksonville due to a hamstring injury .
harrison , who have not miss a game all season , be list as one of the inactive player .

now , after guide the colt back to the playoff -- and break cam newton single - season pass record for a first - year player -- it safe to say luck exceed just about all of they .

the chief have rally behind jamaal charle 226 yard rush to tie the game 13 - 13 head into the fourth quarter .
the colt defense stuff quarterback brady quinn on fourth - and - inch to give luck a chance .
that all he need .
after a miserable stretch in which he connect on 1 of 13 pass , the fabulous freshman calmly lead indianapolis -lrb- 10 - 5 -rrb- downfield .
he complete a key pass to t . y . hilton on third down and make two nice throw to wayne before hit the veteran in the back of the end zone .
we have so many opportunity all game , especially on third down , that we squander , '' wayne say .
we want to get that do .

peyton hilli add 101 yard on the ground for the chief -lrb- 2 - 13 -rrb- , who have 352 yard rush in a lose effort -- the first time that happen in nfl history .
a big reason why be quinn , who be just 10 of 22 for 162 yard with two interception .

yet prosecutor who spend the last month urge juror to sentence one of atlanta 's most notorious criminal to death be not celebrate .
'' the community have speak , '' fulton county district attorney paul howard say at a emotional press conference after the sentencing of brian nichol .
'' even though we be puzzle and terribly disappoint by the decision , we must accept the conclusion provide by we community . '' .
it show how difficult it be to get a capital sentence in atlanta 's fulton county , where death penalty be rare even in a state where support for capital punishment be widespread .
georgia tie for third in carry out execution last year .
and it underscore the problem georgia prosecutor say they frequently face with the requirement that death sentence can only be return by unanimous jury verdict .
nichol , 37 , be find guilty last month of murder a judge , a court reporter , a sheriff 's deputy and a federal agent in the march 2005 rampage .
after four day deliberate on whether to recommend the death penalty , the jury deadlock at 9-3 .

'' georgia be a conservative state , but there be pocket where it be not , '' say state rep. barry fleming , a republican who lead a fail bid last year to allow judge to approve death penalty even if one or two juror vote against it .
'' there be people who will attempt to nullify the law when they get on the jury . '' .
the last time a fulton county jury issue a death sentence be eight year ago , and only then for a triple murderer who kill a toddler .
one factor could be race .
the county be 43 percent black , and numerous poll and survey have find that black be more likely than whites to oppose capital punishment .
eight of the juror be black .
the three who vote against the death penalty would not comment , but howard say other juror tell he the three holdout refuse to deliberate .
he say he be tell that one be wear headphone during the closed-door discussion this week .
two juror who speak at howard 's news conference but decline to be identify say they work hard to try to reach a verdict .

'' it be very hard for 12 people to sit down around the table to make a decision to put another human be to death , '' say stephen bright , a yale law school lecturer and a veteran capital defense attorney .
nichol , who argue he be insane when he carry out the killing , speak for the first time in court on saturday as relative of the victim ' family quietly weep .
'' i just want to say that i know that the thing i have do cause a lot of pain and i be sorry , '' he say .
'' and i just want to say that i will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life .

the frustrated prosecutor gamble on get a death penalty decision when he deny a nichol offer a year ago to plead guilty in exchange for a life prison sentence .
he say saturday that he would urge georgia lawmaker to amend the law - that now require a unanimous decision - to allow a 10-juror majority approve a death penalty .
'' we be not ask for favor - we be just ask for a level playing field , '' howard say .
'' people who will not deliberate should not be permit to continue to serve on jury . '' .
he be especially vex because the holdout be evidently not truthful when question by lawyer about whether they could impose the death penalty before they be choose for the jury .
he say all the juror swear under oath that they could consider death for nichol if they feel the crime deserve it .
inside the jury room , however , the three holdout tell the other nine juror that they would not impose death for any killing .
in fact , howard say , the nine pro-death juror ask the three holdout how many people would nichol have to kill before they would be willing to vote for execution .

'' we be able to state we opinion .
but we would not back down . '' .
it be the pro-death majority , hope to sway the three holdout , who seek the replay of the bombshell jailhouse tape recording of nichol talk with he brother on a telephone call .
'' we be search , '' juror no. 12 say .
a angry nichol be record say he do not regret the four murder and would have take he rampage to the da 's office in the courthouse if give the chance again .

josh moore , one of the defense lawyer , have remind the judge earlier that unanimity in the penalty phase be not require .
'' georgia law show no preference for a unanimous verdict in the sentencing phase of a death case , '' he say .
howard say state law be murky on whether a judge could inquire or replace juror during the penalty phase .
the law also permit each juror to follow he or she personal morality on determine whether to impose a death sentence , as long as the juror can honestly consider it .
howard say he hope the legislature also would change the law , which permit vague response during jury selection on whether potential juror would be willing to impose the death penalty .

hansbrough break unc score record .
the tar heel and the purple ace play a game , but the attention be on record-setting unc senior tyler hansbrough .
since the day he step foot on north carolina 's campus , forward tyler hansbrough have be work to diversify he offensive resume by try to extend he shooting range .
but it seem appropriate that when it come time to break unc 's three-decades-old career score record during the top-ranked tar heel ' 91-73 basketball victory over evansville on thursday night , the senior go back to a old staple : a workmanlike power move .
with 7:42 leave in the first half at the smith center , hansbrough muscle around purple ace forwards jame haarsma and pieter van tongeren to bank in a shoot off the glass and score he 10th point of the game and 2,292 point of he career .
that basket break the mark of 2,290 that point guard phil ford set from 1974 to 1978 .
hansbrough finish with 20 point and now have 2,302 for he career .
'' it be very fitting -- three guy on he , he be move to the basket , kind of off-balance , he bank it in with he soft hand , '' say gene hansbrough , who surprise he son by attend the game .
'' it be a perfect shot for tyler to break the record on . '' .
point guard ty lawson also chip in 16 point for the tar heel -lrb- 10-0 -rrb- , though coach roy william look frustrated at time by he team 's performance , particularly after evansville 's shy ely end the first half with a dunk .
that lead the coach to stomp off the court despite the fact that he team lead by 18 point .
the night , however , belong to hansbrough , who accept the game ball and a embrace from ford , now a assistant coach for the nba 's charlotte bobcat , immediately after set the record .
after the game , ford press he hand together and bow to the big man at mid-court , congratulating he as fan in the sellout crowd -- some of whom hold sign read '' phil ford 2,290 '' on one side and '' tyler 2,291 + '' on the other -- be on they foot for a rousing ovation .
'' it be a honor to be compare in the same breath at tyler , '' ford say later .
'' when i see how hard he play , and how he listen to coach william -- as a player , that be why i try to do . '' .
then hansbrough -- who follow he record-breaking bucket with a miss dunk attempt that probably will make the team blooper reel -- choke up as he watch a montage of current and former player congratulate he on the accomplishment .
'' i get a little emotional , because you may not know all those guy -lsb- in the video -rsb- , but you have get a connection , because you play here and you be part of something that i consider a family , '' he say .
hansbrough , who also grab nine rebound , have already secure he place in tar heel history -- and in the retire jersey portion of the smith center rafter , near ford -- by earn consensus national player-of-the-year honor last season .
break such a long-standing record add to he still-blooming legend .
ford pass the likes of lennie rosenbluth , charle scott and larry miller because they could play varsity basketball for only three year .
antawn jamison , michael jordan and rashad mccant fail to pass ford because they stay just three season .
then come hansbrough , the sometimes awkward-looking big man from poplar bluff , mo. , who opt to forgo go to the nba after he freshman , sophomore and junior season in order to try to win a ncaa title .
although he say he be a little nervous stray from the lane he rookie season , he actually score he first tar heel bucket on nov. 19 , 2005 , when he lead a three-on-two fast break against gardner-webb that finish with he jump shot in the lane .
and he have barely slow since , top unc 's chart for all-time free-throw attempt -- he pass the 1,000 mark thursday night -- en route to he latest record .
'' i want it on a 3 , '' hansbrough say of the record-setting bucket , '' but in a game , i realize you have to do what you have to do . '' .
which in he case , mean play with power and hone he improve finesse .
if he remain healthy , the combination probably will help he become the acc 's all-time lead scorer , as well .
former duke star j.j. redick hold that mark with 2,769 point .
'' i do not put anything past tyler .
if somebody tell I he be go to break the nba score record -- boy , that be go to be hard -- but you never say never when it come to tyler , '' gene hansbrough say .
'' he be get a strong will . '' .
danny green -lrb- 14 point -rrb- become the 61st player in unc history to score 1,000 point when he bury a 3-pointer in the second half .
the historical record will show that with 7:42 remain in the first half against evansville 's purple ace , tyler hansbrough become unc 's all-time lead scorer , slip a screen , fight through a double-team , and banking in a two-pointer for he tenth point of the game and the 2,292 point of he career .
the record will show this in no small part because at least 20 sportswriter be diligently typing behind the home basket , write version of the same word at the very same moment .
if there be go to be any mistake , it be quickly correct by carolina 's sport information army , abuzz all evening to ensure the moment be preserve perfectly .
then there be the photographer , on hand to document each move , each point , each congratulatory handshake .
beyond they , more than 20,000 witness run they own internal documentary system , surely think about how they will tell future generation of tar heel fan that they be present .
some might remember the moment come at 7:41 , a tick of a second later than the actual basket , when the game clock be stop for a tastefully brief ceremony and the obligatory photo op .
let the record show they memory be wrong , but it will not diminish the tell and retell until history become legend , as it usually do .
often history happen in quieter place , witness by fewer people , not fully appreciate or understand until much later .
but this episode be not leave for chance .
it have be anticipate for month , ever since carolina 's lunch-bucket all-american decide to return for he senior season -- not because he care a lick about break phil ford 's almost 30-year-old record , but because he love student life on campus , love basketball , and want to keep do both at the same time as long as possible .
the only hitch in the script be a sore shin and a twisted ankle that defer the night for a few week , into late december , a early christmas gift to the faithful who fill -lrb- well , almost fill -rrb- the smith center on a misty night .
everything else follow the script nicely .
espn dutifully ensure a national audience would share the moment on television .
then hansbrough 's father , gene , make he surprise arrival at a game he be not expect to attend .
but how could he miss it , really ?
have nurture he son 's talent and he competitive drive and he character and everything else along the way , history demand he be in he seat , ready to stand and salute he son as he swallow down the lump in he throat and express he love and thanks .
evansville prove the story 's perfect villain , keep it close through the early stage , and give a already charged-up crowd opportunity to boo lustily as the purple ace ' physical big man knock hansbrough to the ground on several occasion .
do not they know that be how hansbrough would have want it -- physically challenge , and therefore determine to crush they into submission ?
ford , meanwhile , make a gentlemanly entrance , gracefully shake hand with fan of all age , pose for picture , and wait in the wing for history to arrive .
after it do , he be pure class , thank roy william , hansbrough , and the university for ask he to be a part of the night .
'' it be a dream come true for I , '' he say , sound genuinely honor to be pass the torch to a player who , like he , give he best for the program and properly understand that team success , not individual record , be the real measure of success .
even with the game underway and subject to unpredictable bounce , a official 's phantom call , or some other twist of fate , the script hold .
the first point come from the foul line , swish through the basket without a doubt , as they have more often than for any other carolina player before he .
one reminder of greatness in the book .
the next point rapidly follow on a series of jumper , well beyond the range of anything doubter expect the brawling forward to hit on a regular basis when he be a freshman .
'' i will prove you wrong , '' you could almost hear he think as he hit each one , showcase the senior 's evolution into a complete player .
another reminder : player like this come along only once in a generation .
then there be the struggle , as teammate work to get he the ball in score position .
have tell everyone he want to break the record on a three , he camp out on the wing for one possession but fail to get a touch .
on another , he post hard inside as danny green take and miss a open three ; .
as the heel run to the other end , william appear to holler at green for fail to look inside first .
on this night , with history loom , even good quality shot need to wait for the moment .
but the struggle be need , too .
have not that be the essence of carolina 's working-class hero : the battler , scrap for everything , find success as much through passion as through athletic ability or skill ?
it take will -- and a brief stint on the bench -- before the moment come .
then , sure as sure , it do .
because it do , a number of thing will be quickly forget .
though tywon lawson have another dominant performance and danny green -lrb- who break a milestone of he own with he 1,000 career point -rrb- showcase the increasingly confident game that make he summer draft experiment seem less surprising , the tar heel grind they way through a game with 16 turnover -- two more than evansville -- and only 17 assist .
deon thompson never establish a rhythm , take out of he finesse game by the purple ace ' physical style .
early in the second half , william yank out all five starter and replace they with a blue team , unhappy with the focus and effort .
and wayne ellington 's shooting slump continue , he normally perfect stroke disconcertingly slow to return from the final break .
it be another double-digit win , and against a quality mid-major opponent , but a work of art it be not .
hansbrough , who look as though he be press all night despite finish with another 20-point , 9-rebound performance , admit to the nerve .
they be particularly evident on he next touch after the record-breaking point , when hansbrough steal a inbound pass , only to brick a dunk attempt off the back of the rim -- another moment that will probably be erase as history give way to legend .
'' i feel like there be a lot of pressure , '' he say .
'' i do not want to strictly focus on the score record .
we have a game and i be try to do whatever i could to help the team .
now i be glad it be over , and i be ready to move on . '' .
william agree .
'' i say , '' i be glad we get that behind we , now let 's focus on play better , and let 's focus on guard somebody . '' .
i do not look up at the scoreboard , but it be the first time that i can ever remember count point in my head .
so when -lsb- the shot -rsb- go in , it be immediately a feeling of elation , and -lsb- then -rsb- a feeling of relief that we get that out of the way . '' .
danny green acknowledge the team be ready to move on as well .
'' yeah , definitely , '' he say .
'' the one record we want to break be the win record , go undefeated for a entire season and hopefully get a national championship .
that be the record i want to achieve . '' .
history will remember this night , the emotion of the tribute video that follow the game , and the warmth of the celebratory laughter in the media room .
but in the locker room , business remain .
and in a brief quote that will probably be lose to memory , phil ford tell the real story of the night in word that will echo until winter turn to spring .
'' when i be coach here , if we do not make the final four , it be a bad season , '' he say .
'' and now , this guy , '' he continue , look to hansbrough , '' if he do not win a national title , he have a bad season . '' .
hansbrough do not flinch , but the eye flash with recognition .
the record be set , but history be still wait .
hansbrough break ford 's all-time score record at north carolina during the game .
a captive audience that include a emotional tyler hansbrough watch intently as the smith center video board mix in congratulatory remark with the collection of memorable play .

ott '' s thought : creighton return to mvc semi with win over drake .
post on march 09 , 2013 .
the roar .
my goodness , the roar .
take approximately 7 , 000 creighton hoop fan .
ply they with a cocktail or two .
heap a few heavy dash of high expectation for the weekend , and shake it all up with one big sense of be on vacation .
that concoction look like a blue - out in the scottrade center .
it sound like a overwhelming tidal wave of blue - clad crazy crash onto the hard court after every doug mcdermott make and terrible officiate call .
creighton fan overtake the turnstile in st . loui friday afternoon .
they come from all over the midwest and beyond to see cu win the weekend , and the bluejay oblige the first of three requisite win for a arch madness championship .
drake put up a fight ; the bulldog twice cut creighton '' s lead to 3 point midway through the second half .
but a 15 - 2 run during 5 minute late in the game seal the deal for the jay , who will meet indiana state in the semifinal saturday afternoon after the sycamore outlast evansville 51 - 50 friday .
creighton '' s win over drake be historic for a few reason , chief among they mcdermott set the creighton career score record .
mcdermott score 10 of the team '' s first 17 point , display a mix of three - point touch and the ability to finish around the rim .
you know , classic dougie fresh .
those 10 point tie mcdermott with rodney buford , creighton '' be all - time lead scorer .
and as those of we in the crowd who pay attention to such thing hold off on a bathroom or beer trip to watch he score one more point to break the record , mcdermott wouldn '' t do so for another 8 minute of game time .
still , it be inevitable .
and a bit anticlimactic , frankly , when he toe the free throw line and set the record with a one - for - two trip to the charity stripe .
still , that mcdermott break rodzilla '' s record in just three season be wild to I .
i '' m lucky to say i '' ve be able to watch mcdermott , buford , bob harstad , and chad gallagher -- the school '' s top four scorer in history -- during my time on earth cheer for the jay .
but have you tell I after that ncaa tournament game in 1999 that buford '' s record would be best by a guy in only three season , i '' d have call you nut .
or , as the kid around the valley type on twitter right now , #nutz .
as for the entirety of he afternoon , mcdermott be usual dependable doug .
with a building full of nba scout hang on he move -lrb- and , later , on illinois state '' s jackie carmichael '' s ridiculous individual performance -rrb- , mcdermott score 23 point and grab 7 rebound in 35 minute .
he leave the court to chant of '' one more year ! one more year ! one more year ! '' .
indeed .
but for all of mcdermott '' s historic accomplishment and he game - high score output , the storyline from the cu side of thing be the combine play of gregory echenique and will artino .
echenique hadn '' t score much in two game against drake earlier this season : he put up just 2 point in a 30 - point cu win in omaha , and then battle foul trouble all night in des moines as drake upset cu .
and he go scoreless in the first half friday .
but up step artino , echenique '' s sub when the cu coaching staff go in favor of size and a high / low game instead of ethan wragge '' s shoot touch from deep .
friday afternoon , artino give the bluejay 14 energize and efficient minute .
enter february , he have play double - digit minute in just six game .
since the calendar flip from january , though , he '' s have five such game .
friday be arguably he most important performance of the season , give the stake .
artino check in at the under - 16 : 00 media timeout and immediately break a 12 - 12 tie with a dunk .
foul on the flush , he finish the traditional three - point play with a free throw .
two trip later , artino miss a shot but secure the follow and score again .
he would grab two more rebound before check out with 9 : 07 to play in the first half .
while he be in , creighton '' s lead grow as great as 9 point .
in 8 first - half minute , the guy teammate and fan call big swag score 7 point and rip down 5 rebound .
he play the high - low possession well .
while drake hold echenique scoreless in the first half , artino be able to find success .
he finish the day with a career - high 14 point and 6 rebound -lrb- 5 on the offensive glass -rrb- .
in the second half , though , echenique get , um , engage with thing .
he score all 11 of he point , grab 6 of he team - high 11 rebound , and swat 5 of he season - high 6 block shot -lrb- the 6 block be second - most in a mvc tournament game -rrb- .
during the game '' s decide 15 - 2 run , echenique score two traditional three - point play , grab 3 of he 11 rebound , and block two shot .
hammer on a no - call and force to play at a disadvantage base on inconsistent refer in the frontcourt , echenique seem fire up .
he flex a few time , too , so as to remind the bulldog who the alpha dog in the paint be on friday afternoon .
the tournament '' s top seed stick around for semifinal saturday .
the 1998 bradley brave remain the only play - in winner to advance past the quarterfinal , when they beat a two - seed creighton team .
wichita state survive a close game against missouri state friday evening , and illinois state break away late from northern iowa to advance as the six - seed .
the valley will have four solid fan basis represent in the scottrade center saturday afternoon , with white and blue and black and gold the predominant color swirl around the lower bowl .
the day set up for some solid matchup .
the last time the two team play , indiana state make creighton look completely lose .
a black out crowd in terre haute help the sycamore to a resounding win .
meanwhile , it take a carmichael karate kick and other late - game miscue for illinois state to practically hand over a win to wichita state in normal .

for mcdermott , it will give he a chance to make more of a orderly transition from college basketball to professional basketball .
he know he '' be take a risk from a financial standpoint .
'' that '' be definitely a lot of money i '' m pass down , but that money could be there next year , '' mcdermott tell reporter thursday .
'' it might not be quite as much , but you really can '' t put a price tag on a senior year . '' .
that be the same theme that mcdermott touch on repeatedly wednesday night in a exclusive interview with the world - herald .
in the final analysis , mcdermott '' s heart win out over the cash .
'' my heart have be tell I all along to stay , but my mind try to take over a couple of time , '' mcdermott say .
'' i just end up trust myself that i be make the right decision . '' .
he mind , of course , focus on the financial benefit that might be he have he decide to turn professional .
base on evaluation he receive from the nba draft advisory committee , mcdermott say , '' there be no doubt in my mind that i would have be a first - round pick . '' .
that would have mean a two - year , guarantee contract that could have be worth between a minimum of 888 , 600 to 1 . 4 million if he have be select with one of the last 15 pick in the lower half of the first round .
that initially have he father recommend that he son turn pro .
'' he know my dream be to play in the nba , and he just feel that this be too good of a opportunity to pass up , '' doug say .
'' but the way i look at it , if i can play in the nba , i can play there the next year just as well as i can next year .
'' i feel there be thing i can work on .
i feel i can still improve my draft stock by play in the big east .
there be a lot of area that i can get better at , and i just feel i '' d be more comfortable do it here in omaha . '' .
mcdermott have hear more than once from outsider that he should turn pro because he have nothing leave to prove as a collegian .
the 6 - foot - 8 , 225 - pound forward have be a consensus first - team all - american in each of the past two season .
he break creighton '' s career score record near the end of the last season .
that argument might have sway some player , but if there be anything mcdermott have show the past three season it '' be that he '' be a unconventional superstar .
he remain as unassuming as the day he step on campus in june 2010 .
he embrace the attention from a adoring fan base that some player might find stifle .
it '' be that fan base , mcdermott say , that figure prominently into he decision .
'' i care so much about creighton , '' he say .
'' there be a lot of people around here that believe in I .
this whole fan base have be with I from the start .
i feel like i owe they one more year . '' .
mcdermott say the opportunity to play in the new conference become more of a factor as he get deeper into the decision - make process .
he admit have creighton remain in the missouri valley it might have make it easier to turn pro .
but the opportunity to play in the big east , and perhaps prove a few people wrong , be too much to pass up .
'' i feel there be a lot of people that don '' t believe we can be successful in the big east , '' mcdermott say .
'' if you ask anyone on we team , we feel that we '' be go to be capable of do some damage there .
'' that play into my decision a lot .
i care for the guy in this program and i care for the coach .
i want to do what i could to help make this transition a successful one . '' .
what didn '' t factor into he decision , he say , be the fear that he would be leave he dad in a tight spot have he bolt for the nba .
as greg mcdermott say thursday , he son '' s 23 point and eight rebound a game will come in handy next season .
but doug say he father and creighton would have be fine have he decide to leave .
'' he never push for I to stay , '' doug say .
in a interview with the world - herald on tuesday , mcdermott indicate he might remain undecided until sunday '' be deadline to declare for the draft .
the agony of the decision - make process be apparent as he speak .
he clearly be undecided .
in discuss he decision wednesday night , mcdermott say he never intend to take so long in make up he mind .
'' i apologize for put people through that , '' he say .
in try to make up he mind , mcdermott say , he put he emotion to a test .
he would go through one day with the idea in mind that he be head for the nba .
the next day , he would approach thing as if he would be return to creighton .
'' i want to see how i feel , '' mcdermott say .
'' i find myself wake up the next day feel a whole lot better when i be think about come back .
but i go back and forth more time than you can imagine . '' .
he say tuesday that he have talk with former creighton all - american kyle korver , now in he 10th season in the nba .
mcdermott also seek the counsel of harrison barne , he former teammate at ame high school who now be wrap up he rookie season with the golden state warrior .
'' he and i talk before the ncaa tournament , and he tell I i should go to the nba if i feel i be 100 percent ready , '' mcdermott say .
'' that really stick with I .
'' harrison tell I that play in the nba be a completely different world .
the money be nice , but you '' be out there fight for you job every night .
it '' be not like college , where you '' be play for the love of the game and for the fan . '' .
in the end , those factor appeal more to mcdermott than money .
'' i believe i '' m go to play in the nba , but i have to do it when i feel i '' m 100 percent ready , '' he say .
'' i feel like i have some unfinished business here at creighton .
i feel like i can be a lot better , and why not do it here where i can have fun for another year .
'' i '' m so relieved .
i feel like a ton of weight have be lift off my shoulder .
i can '' t put into word how happy i be this be behind I and how excited i be to be come back .
this just feel right . '' .

hansbrough break unc 's career score record the carolina way .
during the spring of 1977 , north carolina coach dean smith invite he star guard phil ford , who have just complete he junior season , into he office .
smith tell ford that he have do some research on where ford would be select in the upcome nba draft base on that information , he recommend to ford that he leave school .
ford do not even have to think about it .
he tell smith right away that he be not interested .
'' at the time , a lot of people be not do that , so go pro be not something i have even consider at all , '' ford say .
'' the financial situation be different back then as well .
at the time , my parent be teacher , so get my degree be very important to I .
the opportunity be not worth I not get my degree . '' .
last april , tyler hansbrough face a similar decision , but under much different circumstance .
hansbrough play in a era when not only be it common for undergraduate to turn pro , but in some circle a player be consider a failure if he stay past he junior year .
needless to say , he face a financial opportunity much greater than the one ford confront three decade ago .
hansbrough spend two full week torture himself over the impending decision .
when hansbrough finally tell roy william he want to return for he senior year , he feel like the weight of the world be off he shoulder .
he be so relieved that he do not even leave the weight room when william ask he to come to he office so they could craft a press release .
'' it be a stressful process , '' hansbrough say in mid-october .
'' you be think about what you be go to do with the rest of you life .
every time i think about leave , i think about how much i would miss come home , live with my teammate and do a lot of the fun thing we do .
i just feel like come back would be the best situation for I . '' .
in consider that life decision , it be doubtful hansbrough give much thought to the chance he would have to become north carolina 's alltime score leader if he return .
still , give the century 's worth of tradition that have reign in chapel hill , it be no small feat that hansbrough accomplish thursday night , when he break ford 's school career score mark with less than eight minute to play in the first half of north carolina 's game against evansville .
north carolina have establish itself as the gold standard of college basketball , and in the soft-spoken , hard-charging , 6-foot-9 power forward from poplar bluff , missouri , this proud program have a worthy standard bearer .
ford be correct when he say that people be not appreciative enough of hansbrough 's skill , but there be no doubt that what set this young man apart be the intensity with which he play .
if ford be a classical symphony , hansbrough be a heavy metal rock concert , power , jostle , bang , and always , always out-hustle he opponent en route to the basket .
it be instructive that while hansbrough remain ninth on the acc 's alltime score list , he be already the league 's career leader in free throw attempt .
if he stay healthy , he will likely leave north carolina as the school 's alltime rebound king .
more than anything , though , tyler hansbrough deserve this record because he come back to school .
this be not to disparage player like michael jordan , antawn jamison and rashad mccant who might have have a shot at ford 's mark have they stay .
but at a place like north carolina , which embody team play , the score record should belong to a four-year player .
hansbrough would probably not have be a top-five draft pick have he leave , but it be unlikely he will signifcantly improve he draft status by play another year .
also , at the time hansbrough make he decision he be assume that at least one of he fellow undergraduate , and as many as three of they , would be turn pro , diminish the tar heel ' chance of win a championship .
hansbrough come back anyway , and for all the right reason .
ford also point out that because freshman be not eligible to play varsity ball from 1954-73 , a huge swath of mega talent who suit up for unc do not have the chance to hold onto this record -- include the man ford pass , lenny rosenbluth , who still hold the school 's record for career score average -lrb- 26.9 -rrb- and be fourth in point score .
hansbrough be sixth on the school 's career score average list at 20.2 .
still , it take a special individual to eclipse a record that have stand at a place like north carolina for 30 year .
ford remember little about the night he pass rosenbluth .
he believe he break the record late in the first half , the game be not interrupted , and neither he nor rosenbluth have much to say about it .
in fact , rosenbluth be not even there that night .
when i ask ford if he still have the game ball , he say he think he might , but he have move so much in recent year -lrb- he work as a assistant coach for the detroit piston and new york knick before join the charlotte bobcat last year -rrb- that he think the ball may be pack away somewhere .
'' to be honest , i be just happy to get it over with , '' ford say .
'' i do not want anything distracting from the team . '' .
if the circumstance be different than they be in 1978 , the central tenet of the carolina way have endure , from rosenbluth to ford to hansbrough .
while offer he congratulation to hansbrough , ford be quick to add that the career score record be the least important mark at north carolina .
'' we never care who score the ball , '' he say , '' as long as someone with the carolina jersey get the ball in the basket . '' .
tyler hansbrough would be the first to agree , even as he jostle and bang he way towards history .

regina benjamin u . s . surgeon general nominee .
july 13 , 2009 .
president barack obama hold a press conference , july 13 , 2009 to announce he nominee for u . s . surgeon general , regina benjamin .
here be the transcript of the announcement .
president barack obama : before i introduce america next surgeon general , would like to say a few word about we ongoing effort to reform the health care system that she will help oversee .
we be now closer to the goal of health care reform than we have ever be .
over the last several week , key committee in the house and the senate have make important and unprecedented progress on a plan that will lower cost , provide better care for patient and curb the worst practice of the insurance company .
it a plan that will not add to we deficit over the next decade .
let I repeat that : it be a plan that will not add to we deficit over the next decade and eventually will help lower we deficit by slow the skyrocket cost of medicare and medicaid .
now , even though we be close , have get no illusion that it go to be easy to get over the finish line .
there be go to be more debate and more disagreement before all be say and do .
but health care reform must be do .
i know there be those who believe we should wait to solve this problem or take a more incremental approach or simply do nothing .
but this be the kind of criticism we hear when the country try to pass medicare , a program that be now provide quality care to generation of american senior .
it the kind of criticism we hear when we try to pass the child health insurance program , which have provide quality care and coverage to million of kid .
it the same washington thinking that have ignore big challenge and put off tough decision for decade .
and it be precisely that kind of small thinking that have lead we into the current predicament .
so , make no mistake : the status quo on health care be no longer a option for the united state of america .
if we step back from this challenge right now , we will leave we child a legacy of debt , a future of crush cost that bankrupt we family , we business and , because we will have do nothing to bring down the cost of medicare and medicaid , will crush we government .
premium will continue to skyrocket , place what amount to another tax on american family struggle to pay bill .
the insurance company and special interest that have kill reform in the past will only continue to benefit even more , and they continue to deny coverage to american with pre - exist medical condition .
people will continue to lose health insurance just because they lose they job or they change job .
this be a future that we can afford .
this country not afford to have health care premium rise three time faster than people wages as they do over the last decade .
we not afford 14 , 000 american lose they health care every single day .
we not afford a future where we government will eventually spend more on medicare and medicaid than what we spend on everything else .
during the campaign i promise health care reform that would control cost , expand coverage and ensure choice , and i promise that american make 250 , 000 a year or less would not pay more in tax .
these be promise that be keep as reform move forward .
this be no longer a problem we can wait to fix .
this be about who we be as a country .
health care reform be about every family health , but it also about the health of the economy .
so , i just want to put everybody on notice , because there be a lot of chatter during the week that i be go : we be go to get this do .
inaction be not a option .
and for those naysayer and cynic who think that this be not go to happen , not bet against we .
we be go to make this thing happen because the american people desperately need it .
and even those who be satisfy with they health care right now , they understand that if premium keep on double and if employer keep on shed health insurance because it unsustainable , and if you look at the trajectory of where medicare and medicaid be go , then inaction will create the biggest crisis of all .
and so i understand people be a little nervous and a little scared about make change .
you know , the muscle in this town to bring about big change be a little atrophied , but be whipping folk back into shape .
we be go to get this do .
and if there anyone who understand the urgency of meeting this challenge in a personal and powerful way , it be the woman who will become we nation next surgeon general , dr . regina benjamin .
the list of qualification that make dr . benjamin a outstanding candidate to be america lead spokesperson on issue of public health be long indeed .
she be in the second class at morehouse school of medicine and go on to earn a m . d . from the university of alabama at birmingham and a mba from tulane .
she serve as associate dean for rural health at the university of south alabama college of medicine , and in 1995 , she become the first physician under 40 and the first african - american woman to be name to the american medical association board of trustee .
in 2002 , she become president of alabama state medical association , and she have receive numerous award and recognition , include the macarthur genius award .
it very impressive .
but of all these achievement and experience , none have be more pertinent to today challenge or closer to regina heart than the rural health clinic that she have build and rebuild in bayou la batre .
do i say that right ?

peter capaldi be the bookie favourite to become the next doctor who .
there have be a surge in bet on capaldi , who play sweary spin doctor malcom tucker in the thick of it , replace matt smith , accord to william hill .
joe crilly , a spokesperson for william hill , say : peter capaldi be not even in we list a few day ago but he have be the subject of a lot of bet interest recently and this gamble would suggest that if he do not have the part already , he be almost certainly on the shortlist . ' .

26-year-old matt smith have be cast as the next incarnation of the doctor .
user on the facebook doctor who forum that i frequent mostly have the same reaction : '' who be matt smith ? '' .
the guy be relatively unknown and the skeptic wonder if the right person be choose .
after all , everyone speculate that paterson joseph , who have appear on a couple episode of the show , be go to be the next doctor and here we get some no-name .
peter capaldi as doctor who : a return to distinguish tradition ?
aug . 05 , 2013 | 2 : 47 p . m .
and as the world -lrb- or one obsess subset thereof -rrb- watch , the name of the person to play the twelfth doctor - though not , of course , the name of the doctor , which shall remain unspoken - be reveal .
peter capaldi , the bookmaker choice by a wide margin , will take over for the retire matt smith , the doctor since 2010 .
smith doctor will regenerate into capaldi - same character , just a different body - this christmas .
the new star of doctor who be best know to american , which be not to say well know , as the f - bombing spin doctor in armando iannucci political comedy the thick of it -lrb- bbc series -rrb- and in the loop -lrb- film spinoff -rrb- and , reach back through the foggy mist of time , for bill forsyth gentle comedy of scotland , local hero . '' .
he be , at any rate , better know to we than be he immediate predecessor , christopher eccleston , david tennant and smith , when they assume the role .
he have twice appear in the whoniverse , as a first - century businessman in the fire of pompeii and a tragic figure at the center of the spin - off torchwood miniseries , child of earth . '' .
he also appear in world war z as a world health organization , or who , doctor .
you feel a little chill then , do you ?
the announcement come sunday , after month of public speculation and wish - listing , conspiratorial sifting of coincidence and reading of tea leave , near the end of doctor who live : the next doctor , '' a bbc special that air here simultaneously on bbc america .
it be not to be confuse with the big 50th anniversary special set for november .
with fifth doctor peter davison -lrb- the cricket - sweater doctor -rrb- and elderly companion bernard cribben as its main in - studio star power and a float tardis -lrb- police - box shaped time machine , for the uninitiated -rrb- introduce as a special guest , '' it be , global interest aside , a small - scale , essentially local , even provincial , event .
because whatever else the new doctor would turn out to be - and , if recent history be any guide he would turn out to be tall , thin , white , clean - shaven , not bald and unconventionally attractive -lrb- check , check , check , check , check and check -rrb- - it be go to be somebody british .
as do jame bond , doctor who posit a world in which the u . k . be still at the center of thing .
it where the alien arrive , and the earth be repeatedly save .
some have hope for a black doctor -lrb- idris elba be often name -rrb- , or a female doctor -lrb- olivia colman , perhaps -rrb- , and as with other great and important office , it do seem only right that it be open to anyone , regardless of gender or color .
indeed , if it seem just possible this time , it hard to believe the next doctor not break one of those line , or both .
that capaldi be a award - win actor of great reputation do not necessarily mean that it will be any easier for he to take control of the tardis .
every new doctor represent a testing of the brand and a testing of the faithful ; there be viewer still mourn the loss of david tennant -lrb- no . 10 -rrb- , and undoubtedly some who feel nothing be as good since tom baker -lrb- no . 4 -rrb- quit , back in 1981 .
it be also , and not incidentally , a test of the show runner , steven moffat , who come in with smith , follow series - rebooter russell t davy .
show runner be a thing we know about now ; we know whom to blame , and moffat draw a fair share .
still , first reaction seem on the whole approve , though some younger online commenter bemoan capaldi age - 55 , the age of william hartnell when he create the role , back in 1963 .
fangirl who crush on the younger eccleston , tennant and / or smith wonder how they would adapt to a doctor old enough to be they dad .
there be , of course , plenty of precedent for gray - hair swashbuckler -lrb- you gandalf , actually call gray , you obi - wan kenobus , you very vibrant third doctor , john pertwee -rrb- .
and moffat can always create companion for raw youth appeal , as be the original custom .
-lrb- hartnell doctor travel with a granddaughter . -rrb- .
certainly , capaldi represent a change from matt smith - think by some to be too young for the part when he take over , ironically - but he also offer a range of new tonal possibility , some of which be also old possibility .
moffat may be more of a who classicist than davy , who bring sex , romance and a will - they - not - they element to the series .
it may be time for the return of a more fatherly doctor .
if you look back across the whole life of the series , capaldi seem very much in the tradition - a likely , almost obvious choice .
he have the authority , the madness , the sweetness .
at the same time , we not know how moffat plan to write he .
the doctor be as constant as the star and as changeable as the wind ; he be a warrior clown , comical and stern , a thousand - year - old child , a tenderhearted soul who love humanity and yet be renown across the universe as the scourge of world .
-lrb- typically , these be world that deserve a scourge . -rrb- .
there be a lot of room to play in there .
fan - especially british fan , whose allegiance span decade and generation , speak of my doctor as if every citizen need to have a favorite - do have strong idea about what the doctor should be .
but variety be in he nature , and in choose to take this ride , we agree to accept the authenticity of the latest anointed choice - a choice no more in we hand , after all , than it be in the doctor .
he be always surprise by who he next find himself to be .
for most viewer the doctor shape himself to the actor , even as the actor shape the part .
you want to honor the tradition , naturally , and you not afford to alienate you audience .
still , fear of change be a poor basis for creative decision - the point , moffat tell hero complex recently , be to bring the world around : you want people to go , no , that would never work ! ' ... ... ...
and they always get wrench out of they comfort zone , and then they find the doctor again .
and there such a range of what the doctor can be . '' .
be excite .

esther william , olympic swimmer turn actress and pinup girl , die at 91 .
esther william , the swimming champion turn actress who star in glittering and aquatic technicolor musical of the 1940s and 1950s , have die .
she be 91 .
william die early thursday in she sleep , accord to she longtime publicist harlan boll .
william in a bathing suit become a favorite pinup of gi in world war ii , and she popularity continue afterward .
bettie page , the 1950s pin-up queen and pop culture icon who die on thursday , will be remember for she indomitable influence on style , fashion , and sexual expression .
but as bettie 's biographer -- and the only one with whom she ever cooperate -- i can tell you that the underground bondage queen also have the unlikely effect of thematically shape a series of biographical and highly feminist novel about powerful woman in history .
in 1991 , intrigue by the resurgence of bettie 's image in venue as diverse as rockabilly club , nostalgia rag , and s and m fashion go mainstream , i write a cover story for the l.a. weekly , '' in search of bettie page . '' .
for nine month , i have track down anyone who have ever know she or photograph she .
but bettie herself , the object of much speculation , remain elusive .
most people think she be dead .
then , as fate would have it , someone give bettie , who be live in anonymity and seclusion , a copy of the article .
imagine the shock -- a seventy-something senior citizen who run away from it all forty year prior , suddenly find that she be famous again .
but she like it .
though she do not want to re-enter the public arena , bettie send I a letter praise the piece , call we '' kindred spirit . '' .
soon , with co-author jame swanson , i embark on the adventure of write she biography , sit down with she for hundred of hour while she tell we she story .
at the time , i be also try to work out how to tell the story of woman in history who have be either drop from the record or misinterpret through the sexist lens of they biographer .
i be to start with kleopatra -lrb- the original greek spelling -rrb- , a victim of roman propaganda remember for the man with whom she sleep rather than for she diplomacy , leadership , and the fact that she have master nine language .
how to present the story of woman who have be victimize without write a victim story , i keep ask myself ?
how to give woman in history who have be reduce to they sexuality the full breadth of they experience without diminish or demeaning they sexuality ?
so here be bettie page , a woman know only for she sexuality , who have be sexually abuse by she father , sexually violate by a gang of stranger , and emotionally batter by a husband .
in the year since she have go underground , bettie have become a born-again christian work for the billy graham crusade .
surely she would repudiate the work she have do as a pin-up and bondage model .
surely she see herself as a victim of the patriarchy that hijack she beauty and sensuality and exploit it for its own gratification .
surely i be about to meet a woman who consider herself a victim .
i be wrong .
despite she more unfortunate experience , bettie never present herself as a casualty of sexual abuse , and she never use that , or she religious belief , which be strong , to renounce the work she have do as a model .
moreover , she never denounce sexual expression .
'' god create we naked , '' she say by way of explain she total lack of inhibition in the buff .
she purported that bondage modeling '' be such fun , '' even at time '' hilarious , '' except for when the elaborate gear become uncomfortable .
and sex itself , she assure I on many occasion , be for she , always pleasurable and joyful .
though she have at time suffer at they hand , she never express bitterness toward man .
i know woman who be resoundingly more hostile than bettie page just for have suffer a few bad date .
no , bettie be not go to allow anyone or anything to diminish the joy she experience when she put that corset on -lrb- or take it off -rrb- and feel she full-blown sexual power .
since the publication of bettie page : life of a pin-up legend , i have publish four historical novel with strong female character .
each , in she own way , be a victim , either of the era in which she live and its law , or of individual abuser , or of the general abuse and oppressive nature of the culture at large .
despite the enormous consciousness-raising of the last few decade , we still see attempt to diminish today 's female powerbroker woman like hillary clinton or sarah palin by sexualize they .
yes , in we porn-saturated society , people be still try to shame woman for -- what ?
have sexual attribute ?
at least we can point to one woman , bettie page , who would not have it .
bettie 's obit paint a bleak picture of she later year .
but i find that , despite she trial , she have retain a zest for life and always take pleasure in memory of the work that she would do .
i hope that bettie be remember for she sexual joy , and for the gleeful spirit she bring to sexual imagery , whether she be frolic on the beach or be ball-gagged and spank , rather than for be a victim .
a female friend of mine say this morning , '' bettie page do more for sexual expression than alfred kinsey '' amen , sister .
for all the countless -lrb- and valuable -rrb- mountain of scholarly and feminist writing that have influence my thinking and my portrayal of woman , i still look to a lady who say it all by look into the camera and defy anyone to tell she she be bad or wrong .
amen to you , too , bettie .
rest in peace .

apple unveil new macbook pro with ivy bridge at wwdc .
june 12th , 2012 .
apple be certainly make wwdc a hardware conference this year - it just unveil a refresh of the exist macbook pro run intel newer ivy bridge processor on the san francisco gathering opening day .
the 13 - and 15 - inch portable run up to 2 . 7ghz quad core i7 -lrb- turbo up to 3 . 7ghz -rrb- , carry up to 8gb of ram and have geforce gt 650m - base graphic 60 percent faster than the previous generation .
like the new macbook air , they tout usb 3 . 0 port .
if you more comfortable with apple conventional macbook pro design than the new variety , apple will ask 1 , 099 for the base 13 - inch version and 1 , 799 for a 15 - inch version , with a upgrade 15 - inch model go for 2 , 199 .
all of they be ship today - be not see any mention of a update 17 - inch version , so it may have be cast aside .
the only hardware release at macworld expo 2009 be a predictable unibody upgrade for the 17-inch macbook pro , which apple report will have a eight-hour battery life .
eight hour be surely impressive for such a large , powerful notebook .
but this news be nonetheless underwhelm for several reason .
some think apple be strategically wait so it could ship the 17-inch macbook pro with a low-cost , quad-core processor .
intel release such a chip just recently , and apc suspect this cpu would appear in apple 's top-of-the-line notebook .
but much to we disappointment , the 17-incher be ship with a plain ol ' dual-core -lrb- core 2 duo -rrb- chip .
true , at 2.66 ghz it be slightly faster than the other macbook pro .
but there be hardly any substantial change to justify the longer wait for this notebook .
apple be able to beef up the macbook pro 's battery by take advantage of the generous amount of space available in the notebook 's enclosure .
this battery be also non-removable , which apple say be necessary to use as much space as possible .
apple also claim the new macbook pro 's battery be more environmentally friendly because it last five year and have fewer toxin .
look like we apple source , and several other in various blog , be incorrect about the rumor of a new mac minus launch at macworld .
we will look into the reason why and provide a update soon .
apple intro new macbook pro , blur line between tablet , computer .
monday , june 11th , 2012 at 10 : 49 be .
apple have unveil the next generation of macbook pro at the wwdc keynote in san francisco .
the 15 . 4 macbook pro refresh will be remarkably thin , at 0 . 71 and at 4 . 46 pound , it will be the thinnest and lightest macbook pro ever .
the display be where the macbook pro refresh truly shine , with a retina display at a whopping 2 , 880 by 1 , 800 pixel .
that amount to 5 , 184 , 000 pixel and 220 ppi , 4 time the current pixel count in the exist macbook pro .

the new macbook pro will start at 2 , 199 for the 2 . 3 ghz quad - core i7 model with 256gb flash storage , and go up from there .
oh , and the best part ?
the new macbook pro start shipping today .
go ahead and start throw you credit card at the screen , folk .
for I the new , unibody macbook pro 17-inch -lrb- pn mb604ll/a -rrb- be probably the most exciting thing announce here at macworld expo .
not only because i be more of a hardware guy but also because i be a macbook freak .
so , where to start ?
the mbp have three compelling new feature .
the new mbp17 have a matte screen option .
can i get a hallelujah ? !
i have be a staunch critic of glossy display in macbook , and i be not the only one .
it appear that cupertino be finally listen .
the unibody macbook pro 17 be the first in the new form-factor macbook to offer a configuration with a matte screen apple call '' antiglare . '' .
it be a $ 50 option though , which be a bit of a slap in the face .
if i be spend $ 2,800 on a notebook computer you would think that apple would throw in the matte screen option .
but at least it be available , which be excellent .
the question that remain be if the matte screen option will trickle down to the mbp15 and even the mb13 .
representative in the apple booth do not know the answer when i ask they today .
the new mbp17 can support up to 8gb of maximum ram -lrb- and have 4gb standard -rrb- which be a huge step in the right direction .
if you can get past the 8gb $ 1,200 sticker price , that be .
i be sure that the ram price be so high because the new 17 ship with two , 2gb 1066mhz ddr3 sdram module and both have to be remove and replace with two , 4gb module to get to 8gb .
price will eventually come down and 8gb be a attractive option for memory hungry application and anything to do with virtualization .
the mbp17 's fix battery be a bit of a scandal .
it be as if apple do not learn its lesson with the macbook air and iphone battery .
after watch the video by the battery engineer during today 's keynote , i be partially convince .
they justification be that fix battery save a lot of room previously occupy by connector , latch and door .
a fix battery can use more internal real estate in the enclosure to store power - go the refrain as a result the mbp17 fix battery hold 40 percent more energy and will last up to 8 hour on a charge -lrb- 7 hour when use the faster nvidia 9600m gt chip -rrb- accord to apple .
i be curious about the real-world run time though .
most company base they battery benchmark on perfect world condition and it will be interesting to see how long the new battery really last .
the third usb port be a welcome addition but it come at the expense of a dedicated fw400 port on the previous model .
solid state drive -lrb- ssd -rrb- be now available as 128mb -lrb- + $ 500 -rrb- and 256mb -lrb- + $ 900 -rrb- option .
in case you be wonder , a max out mbp17 configuration -lrb- 2.93 , 8gb , 256gb ssd and anti-glare -rrb- will set you back $ 5,250 .
start save you nickel and dime , kid .
i be go to wait and see if the anti-glare screen trickle down to the mbp 15-inch before diving in , although the 8gb of ram be attractive .

many resident in the sudanese province of southern kordofan and blue nile fight alongside the south during its civil war with the north .
but the 2005 peace treaty place the two province in sudan territory , leave south sudan to hold a referendum to decide its own fate .
in january , the south sudanese vote almost unanimously to secede from the rest of the country .
they fellow combatant in southern kordofan and blue nile remain on the other side of the border , and a armed rebellion soon begin .

we be prepare for a protracted war , a long war , '' he add , in order to see this regime oust . '' .
in return , the sudanese military have clamp down hard on the rebellion , fill the sky over southern kordofan and blue nile with antonov bomber , some of which have fly over south sudanese territory , too .
a satellite imaging project organize by the enough project , a advocacy group , have publish what it say be evidence of mass grave in the rebellious region , and the unite nation have say the military activity could amount to war crime .
the united state , a close partner of south sudan , have make strong overture to the government in sudan , say that if it cooperate peacefully with south sudan transition to independence , economic sanction on the country could be lift .
but last week , president obama seem to change he mind , call for sanction to be extend over what he call hostile action on the part of the sudanese government that pose a unusual and extraordinary threat to american foreign policy .
they promise we a lot of thing ; nothing actually implement , '' say mr . atti , the sudanese government spokesman .
it unfair . '' .
south sudan - or sudan - can ill afford a new war .
the economy of both nation be in a delicate state , with sudan suffering from a loss of oil income since south sudan independence , and protest spring up in the street of khartoum early this year .
as for south sudan , it be one of the least developed country in the world .
furthermore , it face a number of internal rebellion itself , particularly in province near the border , and it have accuse the sudanese government of back militia there .
the overall view be that they have to exist with the other side , '' say aly verjee , a senior researcher at the rift valley institute .
even if you not trust they so much , and if they be meddle in you own sovereign territory , there be a lot ride on that . '' .

amd buy seamicro , start sell intel - base server .
on march 1 , 2012 at 8 : 12 be .
in a unprecedented move that suggest that there might be life in the old dog yet , amd have acquire seamicro , a company that build high - density , low - power server use intel cpus .
the deal cost amd 334 million -lrb- 281m in cash -rrb- , a fairly sizable chunk of change when you consider that its yearly profit be usually around the 400 million mark .
if you haven '' t hear of seamicro before , they '' be essentially a silicon valley startup build around a technology call freedom fabric , a asic -lrb- application - specific integrate circuit -rrb- that allow a computer to be scale down to a motherboard the size of a deck of play card .
these tiny computer -lrb- each one contain a atom or xeon cpu , some dram , and the freedom fabric asic -rrb- be then stack together to form very - high - density server -lrb- picture above -rrb- .
these server brick be just 10u in size , contain up to 768 cpus , and include four gigabit ethernet switch and a load balancer .
to achieve the same kind of processing power with conventional rackmount server you would need two full rack -lrb- 84u ! -rrb- of dual - socket quad - core server and network gear .
the seamicro server brick use a quarter of the power , too , because the custom cpu - dram - asic contain absolutely no hardware cruft that leech power .
in short , with energy price increase , datum center real estate as costly as ever , and the web show no sign of slow down , seamicro server be really rather desirable .
more than miniaturization , though , freedom fabric be also compatible with multiple instruction set and allow for complete hardware virtualization ; both very desirable property in this age of cloud computing .
but why do amd buy seamicro ?
as it stand , seamicro have a tight partnership with intel , and every seamicro server use intel chip .
accord to amd , seamicro will sell intel - base server '' for the foreseeable future , '' but a opteron - base solution should arrive by the end of the year .
in all likelihood , amd probably see seamicro as a excellent way of bolster its presence in the incredibly lucrative -lrb- and rapidly expand -rrb- server market .
with seamicro , amd can deal directly with company look for server , cut out the -lrb- very profitable -rrb- hp , dell , or ibm middle man .
the server space be one area that amd still seem to be able compete with intel and with freedom fabric amd might once again become a compelling choice .
february 29 , 2012 , 7 : 32 p . m . et .
amd to acquire server start - up .
advanced micro device inc . , amd +0 . 26 vow to change the game in its longtime competition with intel corp . , intc +0 . 93 have forge a deal to buy a silicon valley start - up that take the chip maker into the server business .
the sunnyvale , calif . , company say it will pay 334 million for seamicro inc . , a company know for product call micro server that pack together many chip in way that save space and energy .
such product be particularly popular among company that buy server in huge volume to run popular consumer website .
amd have long battle intel in make chip for server , as well as pc , but it have struggle lately in the larger system because of late product and other issue .
both company , meanwhile , face increase competition from company make lower - power chip that be base on architecture develop by arm holding plc .
last year , hewlett - packard co . announce a partnership with calxeda inc . , a start - up make arm - base micro server .
most chip maker avoid sell system that use they chip , because such move can put they in competition with they customer .
but rory read , a former lenovo group ltd . executive who become amd chief executive in august , have stress the need for unconventional tactic against its much - larger rival .
in a briefing wednesday , amd executive stress that the main motivation of buy seamicro be not to sell server but to offer communication technology and other element develop by seamicro to allow other server maker to make similar product .
we be not intend to compete with we customer , '' say lisa su , who recently join amd to serve as senior vice president and general manager for global business unit .
on the other hand , amd plan to keep support seamicro exist customer by sell server for the foreseeable future , '' m . su say .
those system now use intel chip .
but amd plan to also offer system that use amd opteron chip for server in the second half of the year , the company say .
mr . read have already indicate that amd in the future might offer customer the choice of product that include arm technology .
seamicro , meanwhile , have indicate its technology be also design to support arm as well as the x86 chip sell by amd and intel .
seamicro chief executive andrew feldman , who will become general manager of amd newly create datum - center server solution business , say the company have more than one interested bidder .
but he say it be attract by amd management open attitude toward issue such as support other chip design , as well as a desire to propagate its technology faster than a start - up can .
we come to believe the way to grab this opportunity be the drive of a much larger company , '' mr . feldman say .
the start - up , also base in sunnyvale , originally pass up intel mainstream offering for server , a chip call xeon that be a workhorse for company around the around the world .
seamicro take intel tiny , relatively low - power atom chip know for use in inexpensive laptop computer call netbook and now in smartphone package it for use in datum center .
seamicro last month hold a event with intel and samsung electronics co . to detail plan to use xeon chip in its new machine .
that shift , the company say at the time , allow customer to use its machine for a array of new task that could be address before , such as run web database rather than simply serve up web page .
mr . feldman say wednesday that amd opteron chip would further expand the kind of application that would fit its technology .
jason waxman , intel general manager for cloud computing , say it have enjoy its relationship with seamicro and expect to keep supply chip to the company as part of amd , while work with other maker of micro server .
he note that intel have also be acquire communication - related technology so amd motivation be understandable .
you need a broader technology portfolio to service the need of customer in this market , '' mr . waxman say .
evercore analyst patrick wang say the acquisition be surprising but likely indicate amd commitment to the datum center and cloud computing .
this be the next step in that direction , '' mr . wang say .
but it a very unconventional step . '' .
mr . wang say amd likely be use the purchase to acquire server intellectual property , particularly for the high - performance technology , know as a fabric , that connect all the different processor and disk drive to each other .
the approach allow datum to pass more quickly and efficiently .
supermicro be very successful right now , '' he say .
amd say 281 million of the purchase price for seamicro will be in cash .
the company say the acquisition do change its 2012 financial guidance and the transaction be expect to be add to earnings after 2012 .
amd to acquire server innovator seamicro .
february 29th , 2012 .
in a bold move to boost its position in next - generation server , amd will acquire low - power server specialist seamicro for 334 million , the company say today .
the acquisition be a disruptive one for the low - power server landscape , as seamicro have be use intel chip in its next - generation server , which offer dramatic reduction in power and space usage .
the crown jewel in the acquisition be seamicro '' s network fabric , which allow hundred of low - power processor to work together .
the seamicro architecture be processor - neutral , mean it can be quickly adapt to work with amd '' s technology .
'' by acquire seamicro , we be accelerate amd '' s transformation into a agile , disruptive innovator capable of stake a data center leadership position , '' say rory read , president and ceo , amd .
'' seamicro be a pioneer in low - power server technology .
'' we be clearly skate to where the puck be go , '' read add .
'' this be a great company with innovative ip and great talent . '' .
the importance of the cloud .
amd plan to offer the first amd opteron processor - base solution that combine amd and seamicro technology in the second half of 2012 .
the company say it remain firmly commit to its traditional server business , and will continue to invest in research and development .
but amd executive say the acquisition of seamicro will boost the company '' s offering for cloud computing provider , who be keenly focus on reduce the energy use by they armada of server .
'' cloud datum center be the fastest grow segment of the server market , '' say lisa su , senior vice president and general manager , global business unit .
'' the cloud have change the dynamics of the datum center and how people think about server . '' .
su say amd will offer seamicro server with amd chip to provide continuity for exist customer .
but the primary focus will be on integrate seamicro '' s fabric technology with amd processor in '' building block '' for its oem customer .
downsize '' build block '' .
the basic building block of the seamicro system be a credit card - size compute block , comprise of a cpu and its chipset , dram , and a custom seamicro asic -lrb- application specific integrate circuit -rrb- .
seamicro '' s patent i / o virtualization allow company to save money by use fewer cable and network interface card -lrb- nic -rrb- to connect to network and storage .
seamicro '' s early system feature up to 768 intel atom core in a 10u server .
it recently introduce a server power by 64 intel xeon processor , provide a '' brawny '' offering to supplement the '' wimpy '' atom node .
one of the benefit of the amd acquisition be the ability to adapt seamicro '' s technology to a broader range of workload and application , accord the seamicro ceo andrew feldman .
'' seamicro be found to dramatically reduce the power consume by server , while increase compute density and bandwidth , '' say feldman , who will become general manager of amd '' be newly create datum center server solution business .
'' by become a part of amd , we will have access to new market , resource , technology , and scale that will provide we with the opportunity to work tightly with we oem partner as we fundamentally change the server market . '' .
amd acquire seamicro to grab share of microserver market .
amd 334 million deal with seamicro be a strong move to improve within the ... .
mar 1 2012 , 2 : 35am cet .
amd have make a 334 million bet on the energy - efficient microserver market .
on wednesday afternoon , the company announce that they have reach a 334 million agreement , to purchase seamicro , a successful microserver manufacturer .
launch in 2007 , seamicro quickly gain attention for they ability to combine cheap , low - end processor that could handle web - centric server workload .
the company work closely , if not exclusively , with intel processor in recent year .
seamicro current sm server line use intel atom and sandy bridge processor .
'' by acquire seamicro , we be accelerate amd '' s transformation into a agile , disruptive innovator capable of stake a data center leadership position , '' say rory read , amd president and ceo , in today news release .
for now , amd will continue to sell seamicro server base on intel atom processor accord to pc world .
however , amd expect to release the first seamicro server base on amd opteron processor within the year .
amd to acquire microserver vendor seamicro - - a user of intel chip .
advanced micro device to acquire microserver vendor seamicro for 334 million .
to date , seamicro have use chip from intel .
february 29 , 2012 3 : 24 pm pst .
advanced micro device will acquire server vendor seamicro in a attempt to make a run at intel in the microserver market .
amd say it have sign a definitive agreement to acquire seamicro , a company that supply energy - efficient microserver , for approximately 334 million .
to date , seamicro server have be use intel atom and xeon processor .
future plan call for seamicro to build server with amd opteron chip .
amd plan to offer the first amd opteron processor - base solution that combine amd and seamicro technology in the second half of 2012 .
the company remain firmly commit to its traditional server business , and will continue to focus and invest in this area , '' amd say in a statement .
seamicro innovation include its supercompute fabric , which connect thousand of processor core , memory , storage , and input / output traffic .
seamicro fabric support multiple processor instruction set .
seamicro be found to dramatically reduce the power consume by server , while increase compute density and bandwidth , '' say andrew feldman , seamicro ceo , who will become general manager of amd newly create datum center server solution business .
amd snap up server upstart seamicro .
jumpstart a cloudy server biz with a interconnect .
29th february 2012 .
amd new ceo rory read be fire up about execute better in the server racket at the company analyst day earlier this month and have waste little time in stir thing up with the acquisition of low - power server start - up seamicro for 334m .
seamicro be the server upstart found four and a half year ago that come out of stealth in june 2010 with a atom bomb : a 10u chassis cram with 512 single - core atom server in a 10u chassis , all link by a 1 . 28tb / sec 3d torus interconnect implement on a asic that also virtualize all i / o in the cluster of server node and provide load balancing across those node .
over time , seamicro have add 64 - bit atom , boost the number of atom processor and main memory in the system , and only a month ago announce a variant that use single - socket xeon e3 - 1260l processor to give the sm10000 system some brawny core to do heavier computational task .
the acquisition of seamicro will no doubt irk intel , which have use seamicro as a poster child for its microserver and cloud computing effort in the past two year .
so there some public relation fun in that .
but there not much intel can do about seamicro be in amd hand .
in a conference call with wall street analyst announce the deal after the market close , andrew feldman , seamicro ceo and co - founder , say that he company have be buy atom processor and chipset from the distribution channel , not from intel .
seamicro do not anticipate any change in get its supply of atom and xeon processor or build system for current and future customer .
in the call , read reiterate that amd be seize the inflection point in the server business .
the acquisition of seamicro , which along with cisco system be one of the first new entrant in the server racket in year to actually look like it have a chance of make it , would accelerate out transformation into a agile and disruptive innovator . '' .
as we can now see , look at the past month in hindsight , be that amd figure out that be need to hunker down on its opteron processor roadmap and not force server maker to absorb a socket change in 2012 , as be the original plan , but rather to get a improve piledriver core for opteron processor into the field this year and do lot of performance tuning to show what bulldozer class of chip can really do .
the company then look around and decide that it do need a new chip or chipset so much as a whole different set of technology to sell to its server oem partner .
that where seamicro come in .
much will be make of amd enter the server business with the acquisition of seamicro .
but that not the point , even if it will be technically true over the next month .
lisa su , senior vice president and general manager of the new global business unit at amd , who be task with make sure the company have the component from which server maker want to build system , put the kibosh on that idea .
this be a technology play for we , '' su explain , call the interconnect use at the heart of the seamicro system a unique technology that would be a building block that amd integrate with its processor and chipset and then in turn sell to server maker .
the company will work now to get amd opteron server processor embed in the seamicro machine , which it expect to have accomplish by the second half of this year .
the company will not divulge what opteron chip it will weld onto the seamicro server board , but it stand to reason that it would be a low - voltage opteron 3200 or 4200 part .
in a interview with el reg , mark papermaster , amd cto , deflect all of the interesting question about how the seamicro 3d torus interconnect might be use , such as extend it beyond one chassis to span multiple chassis under a single management and cluster domain , or maybe add cache coherence and share main memory across all or a portion of a seamicro server node .
the acquisition , say papermaster , allow we to redefine the server building block , '' and he note that amd be keen on become a agile soc company , '' refer to system - on - chip design that put processor and other system element into a single piece of glass .
and he confirm el reg sense that amd be not get into the server business .
you have that exactly right , '' say papermaster .
when ask about when amd and seamicro start talk , papermaster would not be specific , except to say that amd move very , very rapidly . '' .
this be quite possibly to keep someone else from buy seamicro and very certainly in part as a reaction to intel purchase of the infiniband networking business from qlogic back in january for 125m .
papermaster would not comment on rumor that amd have be take a look at arm server chip maker calxeda , but it could very well turn out that if amd have try to do that deal , it might be grateful that it fall through .
the seamicro deal be a much better option if it want to sell server interconnect and help oem customer build cloudy server and maybe even cluster supercomputer base on the seamicro freedom fabric , as the latest generation be call .
that fabric be processor and instruction set agnostic , as feldman have say many time , and seamicro only start out on atom processor because they give the best bang for the watt .
and it could turn out that calxeda and amd partner to make arm server somewhere down the road .
why not ?
read want to make sure that everyone understand that the seamicro acquisition would have no effect on the company 2012 and 2013 opteron processor roadmap and system plan , and that amd be not leave the traditional x86 server business .
be in that business to stay , and be go to grow it and invest in it , '' read say .
amd be pay 281m in cash and 53m in stock to acquire privately hold seamicro , which raise 35m in two round of funding and also get 9 . 3m in funding from the we government as part of the 787bn american recovery and reinvestment act -lrb- arra -rrb- of 2009 .
feldman be stay on at amd after the acquisition close and will be general manager of a new datum center server solution business unit , report to su .
both chipmaker be bullish about combine , but a key issue for they will be convincing skeptic they should join together in the first place .
advanced micro device -lrb- amd -rrb- chief executive hector ruiz wax metaphorical as he describe he company 's acquisition of ati technology -lrb- atyt -rrb- .
chipmaker amd , hope to gain a leg up on a resurgent rival intel -lrb- intc -rrb- , on july 24 end month of speculation by say it would buy graphic chipmaker ati for about $ 5.4 billion .
'' we will move from be neighbor to be a family , '' ruiz tell analyst on a conference call .
the two company have long partner in the competitive market for chip that run personal computer and consumer electronics .
but under the same roof , the company will focus on innovation that be particularly attractive to corporate and mobile-computing customer , ruiz believe .
the enlarged chipmaker will combine amd 's strength in fast-computing power with ati 's specialty in deliver detailed graphic onto a single , low-cost chip .
but the problem with families-especially those form by multibillion-dollar corporate mergers-is that they often end up dysfunctional .
promise cost savings and sale increase do not always pan out , and integration of disparate culture and operation be frequently fraught with value-destroying rift .
maybe that be why intel and nvidia -lrb- nvda -rrb- , the company ' two biggest rival , find a lot to smile about on july 24 , the day the deal be announce .
'' i think it be just impossible to get a gift like this , '' crow nvidia ceo jen-hsun huang , in a interview with businessweek.com .
ati be '' basically throw in the towel , leave we as the only stand-alone -lrb- graphic chip -rrb- company in the world . '' .
intel , the world 's largest graphics-chipmaker , decline to comment specifically on the deal .
but company exec have note intel continue to improve its own graphic chipset and that it expect to deliver platform of product , like centrino , that amd can not easily match .
investor be not too sure how happy the amd and ati family will turn out to be , either .
amd share fall almost 5 % on july 24 , to $ 17.40 , extend recent decline fuel by concern amd will be the biggest loser amid a escalate pc industry price war .
'' the assumption of a significant amount of new debt and the need to address integration issue at a time when amd have be seek to step up its competitive pressure in a fierce environment with intel be likely to weigh on amd 's share , '' lehman brother semiconductor analyst tim luke note in a report .
indeed , amd and ati could be distract from they core business for month as they combine into a company with $ 7.3 billion in annual sale and 15,000 employee sprawl through canada , california , and texa .
credit-rating agency fitch rating lower its outlook on amd 's debt to negative from positive on concern the chipmaker 's debt-to-capital ratio will jump to 37 % from less than 10 % because of a $ 2.5 billion term loan it be use to partially finance the deal .
the merger also could lock ati out of the business of supply graphic chipset to intel-based pc , worth about $ 90 million a year in revenue .
ati chipset connect to intel 's processor through what be know as a front side bus , which serve as a highway for transfer datum .
but amd , under a different licensing deal with intel , be not allow to use that front side bus .
'' we be evaluate the deal , and have get a lot to figure out how it would fit in with we exist agreement with both atus and amd , '' intel spokesman chuck mulloy say .
and while ati and amd be busy iron out they new relationship , intel and nvidia be roll out some heavy-hitting chip of they own .
intel and its pc partner on july 27 begin ship for the first chip in a brand-new pc architecture call core 2 duo -lrb- see businessweek.com , 7/24/06 , '' intel sharpen its offensive game '' -rrb- .
first up will be desktop chip , follow closely by new energy-sipping chip for notebook pc .
core 2 duo be expect to wrest the performance crown in the mainstream pc market from amd for the first time in more than two year .
amd will not get a chance to grab it back until mid-2007 , when it be fully ramp on a new manufacturing process .
meantime , nvidia be prep to deliver a new high-end graphic chip later this year that company executive herald as the biggest leap forward in nearly a decade .
after a high-profile delay in deliver a new chip in 2001 , nvidia have be steadily take market share from ati in the lucrative market supply screaming-fast graphic card to the discriminate gaming community .
amd say there be plenty of reason to be bullish on the deal .
the company have its sight on market where nvidia and intel be not as strong .
amd president dirk meyer hope to use ati 's chipset business to develop a energy-sipping combo processing and graphic chip that can be pair with software partner to deliver a platform better able to compete with intel 's new vpro offering .
intel have win early praise from software company and large business for vpro , which bake security and virtualization directly into the chip .
with vpro , tech administrator manage thousand of pc could partition part of the system from workers-a feature that could keep virus from rapidly spread across corporate network .
and ati 's grow business of provide graphic chipset to cell-phone maker nokia -lrb- nok -rrb- and motorola -lrb- mot -rrb- also will give it up a leg up over intel , he say .
intel recently sell its cellular chip business to marvell technology -lrb- mrvl -rrb- for $ 600 million .
'' customer want to get better mobile offering and more stable commercial offering , but they want to know that we be still go to offer they the ability to choose , '' meyer say .
even if relation between amd and nvidia turn frosty and ati lose intel 's business , amd executive predict a combined offering would bring in a additional $ 300 million in revenue in the pc realm alone for every share point gain against intel .
still , not everyone 's sell pip coburn , founder of tech advisory firm coburn venture , note amd have pin its success on a range of variable .
'' i do not want six reason , '' coburn say .
'' i want two reason , two good reason . '' .
amd 's meyer say he know the company have some heavy lifting ahead .
'' the integration task be go to require focus , '' he say .
the biggest job , however , may be convincing skeptic this family be worth form in the first place .
amd announce strategic investment to accelerate cloud server strategy .
on february 29 , 2012 , amd announce a definitive agreement to acquire seamicro , a pioneer in energy - efficient , high - bandwidth microserver .
by acquire seamicro , amd be accelerate we disruptive server strategy , take advantage of a inflection point in the industry drive opportunity in low power , client mobility , emerge market and the cloud / megadata center .
this disruptive move position amd to expand we current server offering and provide we customer with low - power , low - cost , high - bandwidth platform .
with seamicro , amd build upon we processor design and compute expertise with system - level advance in energy efficiency , total cost of ownership and density for customer .
we be excite to have seamicro join amd .
the combination of seamicro ip with amd opteron technology and we focus on execution provide amd differentiate capability to address the evolve need of the server market .
rbc capital market downgrade ati technology to '' sector perform '' from '' outperform '' after advanced micro device announce its intention to buy the canadian graphic chip-maker for $ 5.4 billion on monday .
even though the takeover look fairly value , rbc analyst steve arthur say there be limit upside to the offer unless compete bid be make for atus .
for now , arthur say amd 's takeover deal , which be expect to close in the fourth quarter , effectively offer he one-year price target of $ 21 now .
that price target be set prior to the takeover bid and factored in ati 's gross margin leverage , capital expenditure strength , a competitive product lineup and the launch of microsoft -lrb- nasdaq : msft - news - people -rrb- window ' new operating system , vista , which would be a '' net positive '' for graphics-chip vendor .
without a competitive bid to drive share higher , ati be unlikely to outperform , warrant a '' sector perform '' rating in the analyst 's view .
arthur say a competitive bid be possible but the two most-likely bidder , intel -lrb- nasdaq : intc - news - people -rrb- and nvdidia , face prohibitive anti-trust challenge combine , ati and intel would have 68 % overall market share in pc graphic , while a ati-nvidia partnership would effectively capture 100 % of the discrete graphic market .
other counteroffer could be make by texa instrument -lrb- nyse : txn - news - people -rrb- and broadcom -lrb- nasdaq : brcm - news - people -rrb- , which , accord to arthur , would not so much face anti-trust challenge as they would compatibility challenge .
amd to acquire seamicro : accelerate disruptive server strategy .
seamicro low - power , high - bandwidth microserver solution set the stage for amd '' s disruptive approach to lead fast - grow cloud datum center market .
sunnyvale , calif . -- / 29 / 2012 .
amd -lrb- nyse : amd -rrb- today announce it have sign a definitive agreement to acquire seamicro , a pioneer in energy - efficient , high - bandwidth microserver , for approximately 334 million , of which approximately 281 million will be pay in cash .
through the acquisition of seamicro , amd will be accelerate its strategy to deliver disruptive server technology to its oem customer serve cloud - centric datum center .
with seamicro '' s fabric technology and system - level design capability , amd will be uniquely position to offer industry - lead server building block tune for the fastest - grow workload such as dynamic web content , social networking , search and video .
amd '' s server technology combine with seamicro technology provide customer with a range of processor choice and platform that can help significantly reduce datum center complexity , cost and energy consumption while improve performance .
amd plan to offer the first amd opteron processor - base solution that combine amd and seamicro technology in the second half of 2012 .
the company remain firmly commit to its traditional server business , and will continue to focus and invest in this area .
'' by acquire seamicro , we be accelerate amd '' s transformation into a agile , disruptive innovator capable of stake a data center leadership position , '' say rory read , president and ceo , amd .
'' seamicro be a pioneer in low - power server technology .
the unmatched combination of amd '' s process capability , seamicro '' s system and fabric technology , and we ambidextrous technology approach uniquely position amd with a compelling , differentiate position to attack the fastest grow segment of the server market . '' .
seamicro technology offer substantial advantage in large datum center and cloud environment .
cloud datum center be project to be the fastest grow segment of the server market through 2015 , accord to idc1 .
current system feature seamicro technology typically use one quarter the power and take one sixth the space of traditional server with the same compute performance , yet deliver up to 12 time the bandwidth per core2 .
foremost among seamicro '' s innovation be they supercompute fabric , which connect thousand of processor core , memory , storage and input / output traffic .
seamicro '' s fabric support multiple processor instruction set .
seamicro solution be currently deploy in multiple site across the world .
amd will continue to support all current seamicro customer while accelerate plan to deliver new platform that combine amd and seamicro technology and enable amd '' s oem partner to bring differentiate solution to market .
'' cloud computing have bring a sea change to the datum center - - dramatically alter the economics of compute by change the workload and optimal characteristic of a server , '' say andrew feldman , seamicro ceo , who will become general manager of amd '' be newly create datum center server solution business .
'' seamicro be found to dramatically reduce the power consume by server , while increase compute density and bandwidth .
by become a part of amd , we will have access to new market , resource , technology , and scale that will provide we with the opportunity to work tightly with we oem partner as we fundamentally change the server market . '' .
the acquisition do not change amd '' s 2012 financial guidance and the transaction be expect to be accretive to earnings after 2012 .
amd will fund the cash portion of the acquisition with exist cash reserve .
amd conference call .
amd will hold a conference call for the financial community at 4 : 45 p . m . est today to discuss today '' s announcement .
amd will provide a real - time audio broadcast of the teleconference on the investor relation page of its web site at www . amd . com .
the webcast will be available for 10 day after the conference call .
ati a potent weapon for amd in clash with intel .
the pitched battle for supremacy in the chip-making market reach a critical phase yesterday with advanced micro device -lrb- amd -rrb- in sunnyvale , calif . announce its decision to acquire canadian graphic card manufacturer ati technology -lrb- atus -rrb- .
the imminent purchase of ati , analyst say , be the most vital element in amd 's concerted campaign to dethrone the mighty intel corp .
amd agree to buy markham , ont-based atus for around $ 5.4 billion in cash and stock , the company announce monday .
the acquisition , which be subject to shareholder and regulatory approval , would turn amd into one of the world 's largest provider of graphic chip .
'' you will not see it tomorrow , but the merger will potentially put amd on a more equal footing with intel , '' say michelle warren , a analyst with evan research in toronto .
another canadian analyst note that the merger be likely to bring significant benefit to both company .
amd would round out its graphic process unit portfolio , say eddie chan , lead analyst , mobile and personal computing at research firm idc canada in toronto ati , he say , also blend in well amd 's live ! convergence platform .
'' ati have a strong product portfolio that cover component for such offering as mobile phone , wireless product , digital tv , and high definition tv . '' .
on the flip side , amd allow atus to hitch a ride on the integrate chip bandwagon .
discrete graphic component have be suffer over the year as the market move on to integrated chip such as those sell by intel , say chan .
'' a tie-up with amd allow atus to move towards integrate solution or the so-called system-on-a-chip platform . '' .
the marketing message from ati executive too be all about the mutual benefit ' of the propose acquisition .
adrian hartog , senior vice-president for consumer product at ati , characterize the alliance as a growth opportunity for both company .
it be generally expect that the merged company will harness ati 's strong r and d track record .
in a list release late last year of canada 's top 10 r and d spender , ati technology be in position 5 .
the company spend $ 389.1 million in r and d in 2004 , a increase of 18.3 percent .
the list be release by toronto consulting firm research infosource .
the ati research team have a proven capacity to turn major new product out every 12 to 18 month .
'' bring these two company together will allow we to transcend what we have accomplish as individual business , '' say hector ruiz , chairman and chief executive officer -lrb- ceo -rrb- of amd in a statement .
'' all of we product line will benefit . '' .
earlier , amd reveal plan to build a highly efficient dual-core notebook processor , set for release in the second half of 2007 .
amd enjoy considerable strength in the server and consumer computing industry while ati be consider a leader in the computer gaming arena .
warren say recent year have see these disparate market move closer to each other .
for instance , ati 's shader model 3.0 , which allow more complex shading and more realistic image rendering , be find traction in the enterprise space with company that be heavy computer-aided draft -lrb- cad -rrb- user , include customer in the automotive , aerospace and animation space .
hartog say the purchase of ati by amd will involve ' some change ' but he downplay any potential lay-off from among the company 's more than 3,000 employee .
'' ontario have one of we largest r and d team and that arrangement will continue .
we be not anticipate any immediate lay-off , '' hartog say .
any acquisition raise the issue of employment stability , say warren , but amd would be wise to allow atus to continue operate as it do .
'' there be a strong chance atus will be give a measure of autonomy because it have great strength in its area . '' .
warren say the alliance also '' step up '' ati 's competition with rival nvidia of santa clara , calif. apart from atus , amd also turn to nvidia for graphic component .
'' depend on the contract , it be possible that nvidia 's access to amd chip will be limit , '' say warren .
if that happen , evan research analyst michelle warren say , '' it will open the door for nvidia to search for new option and possibly talk with intel .
however , hartog say there will be no move to constrain nvidia 's supply .
'' nvidia will continue to be amd 's partner .
both ati and amd be commit to open platform system , '' he say .
'' in fact that be what differentiate we to we partner and customer . '' .
amd enter server business with bold acquisition .
02 . 29 . 12 4 : 15 pm .
chip designer and chief intel rival amd have sign a agreement to acquire seamicro , a silicon valley startup that seek to save power and space by build server from hundred of low - power processor .
with the purchase , amd will not only turn itself into a server maker , it will turn itself into a server maker that use chip from intel .
today , seamicro '' s server be build with processor from amd '' s rival , include intel '' s atom mobile processor as well as intel xeon chip .
amd say it will continue to sell and support seamicro server equip with intel chip '' for the foreseeable future . '' .
but it also hope to license seamicro '' s server '' fabric '' technology to other server seller , include big name dell and hp , and it plan to introduce amd opteron chip into seamicro machine sometime in the second half of the year .
seamicro '' s fabric be a way of efficiently connect various piece of server hardware , and the company say it can be use with virtually any processor .
less than a month ago , intel and seamicro hold a joint press event where they predict a bright future together , so it would appear that the amd acquisition come about rather quickly .
but amd '' be lisa su -- the company '' s senior vice president and general manager for its global business unit -- say the chip designer have be eye technology along the line of seamicro '' s for some time .
'' we '' ve be look at the key technology innovation that be go to really disrupt the server market .
we '' ve be look at fabric technology -- externally with a number of company as well as internally , look to develop ourselves -- and we feel that seamicro be really the best option .
it be prove , and it be in system , '' su say on wednesday morning during a briefing with reporter .
'' the complement of we processing capability and seamicro '' s fabric technology give we what we think be a very , very strong -lsb- intellectual property -rsb- portfolio . '' .
amd will pay 334 million for seamicro , include 281 million in cash .
the deal be expect to close in '' a number of week . '' .
base in sunnyvale , california , seamicro be at the forefront of a movement to build server from ultra - low - power processor -- aka '' wimpy core . '' .
the idea be to reduce power by splitting application into small piece that can be spread across a larger number of chip , not unlike the one run you cell phone .
texa startup calxeda offer '' wimpy core '' server equip with chip use the arm instruction set -- a alternative to the x86 instruction set use by intel and amd -- while hp be explore the idea with a research effort it call project moonshot .
but last month , during that press event co - host by intel , seamicro announce that it would also offer server equip with intel xeon chip , which be specifically design for server .
xeon consume more power , but they also offer more speed .
seamicro say that certain software workload be suit to the wimpy core , while other be suit to '' brawny core , '' and this same message be deliver by the likes of dave andersen , the carnegie melon professor who coin the wimpy core name .
whatever processor it use , seamicro say , it can save power and space when you compare its machine to traditional server .
the company have build specialize asic chip load with software that allow the company to build ultra - small motherboard that include little more than processor , memory , and the asic itself -- and then connect hundred of these board .
accord to the company , this technology be '' chip agnostic , '' mean it can relatively easily be use with new chip architecture .
amd and seamicro say that they will '' explore '' the use of seamicro '' s fabric with all sort of processor , both wimpy and brawny .
this may include arm chip .
in recent week , amd have hint that it will eventually license arm technology .
ask if the company will continue to offer ultra - low - power chip along the line of the intel atom , seamicro ceo and co - founder andrew feldman say '' absolutely . '' .
but he decline to point to specific processor architecture .
'' this -lsb- seamicro fabric -rsb- technology can work with larger core and small core .
it can work with x86 and non - x86 .
it can also move ethernet traffic and storage traffic , '' feldman say .
amd chief technology officer mark papermaster then pipe up to point out that amd be intent on use whatever chip technology be need to get a particular job do .
'' if you look at we roadmap , we have a very agile -lsb- system - on - a - chip -rsb- , '' he say .
'' it allow we to be more pushy in bring in we ip . '' .
seamicro currently employ 80 people , and about half of they be engineer .
one of those engineer be founder and chief technology officer gary lauterbach , who be previously a amd fellow and one of five architect who build the core of amd '' s opteron processor .
lauterbach be also a lead chip designer at sun microsystem , and the idea for seamicro first come to he when he and another sun executive get a look at the low - power server that power google '' be search engine in the early part of the last decade .
andrew feldman will become the general manager of amd '' s new '' datum center solution '' business .
accord to su , this business unit will continue to support the current '' roadmap '' for seamicro '' s server .
this mean that the company will sell and service seamicro '' s intel atom and intel xeon system -- though su indicate that the company will eventually drop intel '' s chip .
she say that amd opteron chip will be add to seamicro system '' towards the end of this year . '' .
intel '' s jason waxman -- who head the company '' s general manager of intel '' be high density computing group -- tell wire that amd '' s acquisition of seamicro '' doesn '' t change a whole lot '' for intel .
he say that amd will decide whether to keep sell seamicro server with intel chip , and that intel will continue to reduce the power consumption of both its xeon and atom chip for use inside server .
'' be able to launch the seamicro product with intel xeon silicon be a good testimonial for we .
they think we be the best partner at the time , '' waxman say .
'' they choose we silicon for a reason . '' .
whatever the fate of intel chip in seamicro server , amd say the acquisition be about more than just sell machine .
the idea be also to '' broaden '' amd '' s relationship with server seller such as dell and hp .
presumably , this mean that amd will license seamicro '' s fabric technology to third - party .
'' we have new technology that we can add to we exist opteron roadmap to form something that can really differentiate we in the marketplace , '' su say .
andrew feldman add that seamicro have already have discussion along these line with the likes of dell and hp .
currently , dell resell seamicro server .
that say , the acquisition mean that -- on some level -- amd will be compete with its own customer .
it will be both chip designer and server maker .
but su downplay this notion .
'' we be not compete with we customer .
we have to balance the fact that will continue to support -lsb- seamicro -rsb- product .
but the goal be to proliferate the technology with oem , '' su say , refer to original equipment manufacturer such as dell and hp .
'' what we see be a chance to take we technology to multiple market , with multiple partner , in multiple geography -- in way we couldn '' t do on we own , '' say seamicro ceo and new amd general manager andrew feldman .
'' the opportunity to collaborate with the oem be larger than the opportunity to compete with they . '' .
advanced micro device inc. shake up the personal computer industry by buy ati technology inc. for we $ 5.4-billion yesterday , open up a new front in the battle with intel corp. to control the computer chip market .
the deal , which have be anticipate for over a year , give amd high-end graphic technology and bolster the company 's strategy to overtake intel as the dominant supplier of chip that power personal computer and other device .
as well , intel have be a buyer of ati 's graphic chip and that relationship look to be in jeopardy .
'' this reconfigure the market and put amd in a amazingly new strong position , '' say jon peddie , a independent chip analyst in san francisco .
amd buy sea micro for 334m to get into energy - efficient '' microserver '' .
february 29 , 2012 2 : 27 pm .
there '' be a sea change happen in a segment of the server market dub microserver .
and sea micro have be at the center of it , disrupt the market with energy efficient server that use lightweight processor from intel .
advanced micro device be acquire sea micro today for 334 million , include 281 million in cash .
sea micro have be disruptive because it can pack a lot of compute power in a server rack that be about a sixth of the usual size .
its server use a quarter of the usual electricity and cost a lot less .
the server use intel '' s atom microprocessor , which be target at energy efficient device such as tablet computer .
but amd '' be move could shake thing up for intel , which presumably will lose some of its business .
the advantage of sunnyvale , calif . - base seamicro '' s small and power - efficient computer be that enterprise can now shove a lot more computing power into a give amount of space and use a lot less electrical power , thereby cut electricity bill dramatically .
that matter because electricity cost be the biggest part of the budget for operate datum center .
andrew feldman , chief executive of sea micro have say in past interview that seamicro have become the fastest - grow system company in silicon valley history .
seamicro '' s customer include france telecom , skype , roger wireless , mozilla , eharmony , and china netcom bb .
hundred of million of internet user traverse seamicro '' s hardware daily .
as we '' ve describe in earlier story , intel have be improve its server microprocessor by make they more power efficient .
but the microprocessor only account for a third of the power consumption in a server .
seamicro '' s innovation lie in how it attack the remain two - third of the power consumption problem .
it do so by combine a lot of the extraneous chip into a single , more - efficient custom chip , feldman say .
in its earliest system , seamicro put 384 intel atom dual - core processor -lrb- for a total of 64 - bit 768 core -rrb- in a 10 - rack system , which be just 17 . 5 inch high .
the newer sm10000 - 64hd be a 20 percent improvement over seamicro '' s previous server line and a 150 percent improvement on its compute density record , or the amount of compute power in a give space .
that single machine could replace rival system with a bunch of equipment : 60 traditional server , four rack switch , four terminal server , and a load balancing server .
it use a quarter of the power and a sixth of the space .
seamicro can put a entire server on a motherboard that be 5 inch by 11 inch .
since the hardware be intel - base , customer don '' t have to change they software at all .
seamicro be found in 2007 and be back with 60 million in funding by khosla venture , draper fisher jurvetson , crosslink capital , and a number of strategic investor .
it also win grant from the u . s . departement of energy -lrb- 9 . 3 million -rrb- and the state of california -lrb- 250 , 000 -rrb- .
seamicro have 80 employee .
most recently , it raise 20 million .
seamicro also attack the power consumption problem with a very clever trick know as virtualization .
today , virtualization be frequently use with server .
it be a layer of software that rest between a application and the server that it run on .
if a application need only two server , the virtualization software find two available server to run the application .
if the application get busy and need 10 server , the virtualization software find 10 available server to do the job .
the application be no longer tie to specific server ; the virtualization software free up the overall system and get more use out of the available server .
seamicro do the same thing , but it apply the concept of virtualization to the inside of a server .
feldman design custom chip that could take the task that be handle by everything beyond the intel microprocessor and its chip set .
the custom chip virtualize all of those other component so that it find the resource when it '' s need .
it essentially trick the microprocessor into think that the rest of the system be there when it need it .
seamicro virtualize a lot of function that take up a lot of space inside each server in a rack .
it also do the same with function such as storage , networking , server management , and load balancing .
full tell , seamicro eliminate 90 percent of the component from a system board .
seamicro call this cpu / io virtualization .
with it , seamicro shrink the size of the system board from a pizza box to the size of a credit card .
by boil down the rest of the system into a couple of chip , seamicro can get rid of a lot of the component in a system , thereby get rid of space , cost , and power consumption .
the buy should also expand amd 's manufacturing capability , as well as integrate microprocessor and graphic engine in a single chip .
the acquisition be set to be wrap up by year 's end .
advanced micro device -lrb- nyse : amd -rrb- announce the largest acquisition in its history monday , pay about $ 5.4 billion to acquire graphic chip specialist ati technology .
the acquisition will let amd expand its position in the commercial desktop and mobile computing market , two area where the company have not have much success .
in addition to accelerate the company 's x86 processor market share battle with intel -lrb- nsdq : intc -rrb- , the acquisition will expand amd 's access to manufacture capacity and will lead to product that will integrate both microprocessor and graphic engine in a single chip in future release .
the startup manage large-scale web infrastructure to prevent downtime related to configuration change march madness 2008 be carry in full on the internet , on demand thanks to the technology innovation of cb sport and cb interactive gm 's tech leader talk about consolidate , re-engineering , upgrade the company 's application infrastructure .
'' together we intend to create a processing powerhouse , '' say hector ruiz , chairman and chief executive of amd , during a teleconference to announce the deal .
'' we be confident the company will integrate well together .
we believe that as technology advance , integration be not only inevitable , but also advantageous . '' .
begin next year , the company will market '' customer-centric platform '' use amd and ati technology that will include all exist product offering .
begin in 2008 , amd plan to introduce platform that integrate general purpose processor and graphic engine to meet specific media , datum , and graphic requirement , say dave orton , president and chief executive of ati .
bob rivet , cfo of amd , say the acquisition be expect to be complete by year 's end .
the purchase be a combination of $ 4.2 billion in cash and 57 million share of amd stock .
amd 's current area of greatest strength be provide processor that address the server and consumer desktop market , rivet say .
bring ati 's graphic technology in-house will allow amd to better address the commercial desktop and laptop market , he say , two area where amd currently have a smaller presence .
while overall sale of x86 processor currently total about $ 30 billion annually , amd be primarily address only a segment that total about $ 13 billion , rivet say .
by expand more into commercial desktop and laptop market , amd will be able to grow its overall x86 market share .
rivet say that each percentage of market share gain equate to about $ 300 million in revenue .
ruiz say the acquisition '' open up a broad array of option for expand we capacity infrastructure '' by provide amd with a expand relationship with some of the largest semiconductor foundry in the world .
currently amd utilize internal manufacturing capacity , as well as capacity from chartered semiconductor manufacturing .
ati , however , have manufacture relationship with two of the other largest foundry in the world , taiwan semiconductor manufacturing and unite microelectronics .
the acquisition of ati by amd will now provide computer maker and customer with another choice for integrate microprocessor and graphic processor platform , say bruce shaw , director of worldwide commercial marketing for amd .
currently only intel offer a integrated platform .
although amd will be provide integrate platform , it will continue to support the use of third-party graphic product , such as those from nvidia , in combination with its processor , shaw say .
amd have no plan to reduce the ati product line or back away from market it address , such as cell phone , where amd have little or no presence , he say .
ati be expect to continue to operate out of its headquarters in markham , ontario , and layoff be expect to be minimal .
amd buy seamicro , enter server hardware business .
feb 29 , 2012 2 : 31 pm .
advanced micro device announce wednesday it be buy low - power server vendor seamicro , a surprise move that put amd in the system business and disrupt intel by acquire one of its close partner .
amd will pay 334 million in cash and stock for seamicro , a 80 - employee silicon valley startup that have gain attention for build highly dense and power - efficient server for use in large - scale cloud computing environment .
seamicro ceo andrew feldman will become general manager of a new division at amd , the datum center server solution group .
amd plan to sell seamicro - branded server directly to customer , but it buy the company primarily for its technology , which it hope to license to other server vendor to build they own low - power system , amd official say .
seamicro have a proven technology that have be benchmark in key customer site to show improvement in power consumption and total cost of ownership .
that -lsb- intellectual property -rsb- be very attractive to we , '' say lisa su , senior vice president and general manager for amd product division .
the move will be see as a setback to intel , which have build a tight partnership with seamicro .
all the server seamicro currently sell be base on low - power intel atom processor , and just a few week ago the company hold a joint press conference where intel sing seamicro praise .
a intel spokesman decline to comment on the acquisition wednesday before it be officially announce .
amd will continue to sell seamicro server base on intel processor for the foreseeable future , '' lu say .
by the end of this year , she say , it will release the first seamicro server base on amd opteron processor .
feldman would say when seamicro and amd begin talk but say the deal come about unbelievably quickly . '' .
he say there be other suitor for the company , include non - chip vendor .
seamicro develop a interconnect technology that allow it to eliminate all but three of the chip on a standard server motherboard .
that allow it to develop server that it claim consume one quarter the power and one sixth the space of standard x86 server .
its product be gear primarily towards high volume , web - base transaction workload that not require the computing muscle of a traditional xeon or opteron server processor .
mozilla use seamicro server , for instance , to deliver software update to user .
it not clear which amd processor seamicro will use as a alternative to intel atom chip , though amd have several low - power offering and plan to release a new , low - power chip for tablet , code name hondo , later this year .
however , seamicro have say its technology can also benefit server base on more powerful processor .
a server base on a opteron chip would be efficient for run mysql and mondodb database workload , feldman say , as well as php application use by many online service .
it could also be use to build efficient supercomputer , he say .
it a new direction for amd , one it hope will allow it to expand its server business and capitalize on the fast - grow cloud computing market .
spending on server for such scale out datum center be expect to grow 33 percent a year on average for the next several year , amd say , faster than the server market as a whole .
the move put amd in the difficult position of compete with some of its customer , though lu insist that will not be a problem .
the scale of seamicro business today be much smaller than that of a hewlett - packard or a dell , she say , and amd think the value of seamicro technology to server vendor will outweigh they competitive concern .
amd server business could use a lift , note dean mccarron , principal analyst at mercury research .
they be obviously experience a decline and this would be a way to expand the market for they processor , '' he say .
amd be pay 281 million in cash for seamicro and the remainder in stock , lu say .
it expect to close the deal in march .
graphic talk about nvidia .
address a deficiency of its own and further up the competitive tension between it and chief rival intel -lrb- nasdaq : intc - news - people -rrb- , advance micro device -lrb- nyse : amd - news - people -rrb- intend to acquire graphic chipmaker ati technology -lrb- nasdaq : atyt - news - people -rrb- in a $ 5.4 billion deal .
be intel below $ 19 too cheap to last or still above what the chipmaker 's worth ?
the question for many be where that leave nvidia corp. -lrb- nasdaq : nvda - news - people -rrb- , now the sole independent graphic chip maker address each of the computing , mobile communication and display market .
we think not too much worse off than before the deal , and believe share in the company remain a compelling way to play growth in gaming and media-oriented computing .
we view of the advanced micro device / atus technology deal be that it be the last major move amd need to make to match intel 's breadth in the processor market -lrb- now that intel have shed its communication processor business -rrb- .
intel have have for some time the ability to integrate graphic capability into its offering for pc maker , resource for which amd have have to rely on other folk , include both ati and nvidia .
the amd/ati combination now trump intel 's strategy by add the capacity to package higher-end chip for gaming and complex graphic manipulation .
we be not sure that be a huge game-changer for atus in its ongoing match against nvidia , though .
we doubt amd would shut out nvidia 's ability to integrate with its core processor , as any such move might lessen the attractiveness of amd 's core product to that crowd .
amd acquisition of seamicro put intel on the defensive .
mar 2 , 2012 12 : 30 pm .
intel suffer a setback in the server market this week with the news that its former partner , seamicro , be be acquire by amd .
but the world top chip maker say it be internally develop technology to remain competitive in the dense server market .
intel be develop integrate fabric to boost i / o and high - performance networking and storage in server , say jason waxman , general manager of intel datum center business unit , in a interview .
the technology be be develop as the company try to boost its presence in the market for dense server use in cloud computing deployment in datum center .
amd be pay 334 million for seamicro , which until now be in a tight partnership with intel to develop dense server .
amd plan to sell seamicro - branded server and license to customer its fabric technology , which virtualize i / o and tie together storage and networking .
the deal be expect to close in march .
seamicro provide amd a instant presence in the nascent but fast - grow dense server market , and intel will now be play catch - up , analyst say .
seamicro currently sell server only with intel processor , and it be likely that amd will swap those with its own chip .
intel say it will continue to provide processor for seamicro server , depend on the requirement .
amd purchase of seamicro be a unexpected but smart move , say nathan brookwood , principal analyst at insight 64 .
the dense server market be grow as company look to curb electricity cost by deploy low - power server to respond to web and database query .
but amd prize in the acquisition be seamicro specialize fabric , brookwood say .
seamicro dense server have many credit - card - size motherboard that be connect by the fabric , which reduce the need for extra storage and network controller .
it could take intel year to develop technology that be competitive with seamicro fabric , brookwood say .
and intel will need to prove its technology be reliable before it be widely adopt .
intel have all the piece and all the technology and the smart people to put this together .
but it take time , '' brookwood say .
the seamicro deal give amd a technological head start , but it will also intensify intel focus on develop related technology , say dean mccarron , principal analyst at mercury research .
intel waxman do specify how intel would build the fabric and i / o technology , but say the company would utilize asset from recently acquire network company .
in july it acquire fulcrum microsystem , which make ethernet switch , and last month it purchase infiniband asset from qlogic , which provide high - performance fabric technology for server .
intel also will remain competitive through new processor , memory and system management technology .
but by the time intel fabric technology mature , analyst say that amd could be far ahead in the integration of seamicro technology inside chip .
amd in the future will allow implementation of third - party intellectual property inside chip , and by 2013 or 2014 , seamicro ip could be inside opteron server chip .
currently seamicro asic -lrb- application - specific integrate circuit -rrb- control the fabric be place on the motherboard alongside the processor and memory .
when integrate inside a chip , it could be similar to calxeda energycore chip , which will be use by hewlett - packard in its upcome arm server .
the calxeda chip include cache , a 80 - gigabit fabric switch and a management engine for power optimization .
amd will be able to license the fabric technology to work on arm processor , which could also put pressure on intel , analyst say .
arm processor be mainly find in smartphone and tablet , but there be grow interest in build power - efficient arm server .
amd will be able to differentiate its offering from intel by offer seamicro technology with either arm or x86 processor as early as 2013 , say matt eastwood , group vice president for enterprise platform research at idc .
amd currently offer only x86 chip , but the company chief technology officer , mark papermaster , have not rule out implement arm ip on its future chip .
but intel waxman say the amd - seamicro deal do not change intel dense server strategy , and the chip maker will continue to work with customer like dell and tyan .
a part of we strategy be to provide a full portfolio of ingredient , '' waxman say .
have get the right asset in we arsenal . '' .
taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co. -lrb- tsmc -rrb- share rise yesterday after two of the world 's largest chipmaker say they merger would not create a negative impact on the hsinchu-based foundry , dispel investor fear .
tsmc stock trade on the taiex close at nt $ 53.8 yesterday , up nt $ 0.9 from the previous trading day .
yesterday advance micro device inc. -lrb- amd -rrb- , a lead global cpu maker , announce its purchase of canada-based graphic chip maker ati technology inc. in a we $ 5.4 billion deal that many say would help amd compete more effectively with intel corp. , its largest-in-the-world rival .
analyst also say the merger would cause a reshuffle in the global pc industry , affect chip foundry - include tsmc - that manufacture intel-based graphic chip for atus on a original equipment manufacture basis .
ati , the largest maker of computer graphic chip for notebook computer , outsource the manufacturing of its chip , while advanced micro have facility to produce some of its own processor .
in a news conference announce the merger hold in taipei yesterday , henri richard , executive vice president of amd , urge investor not to worry as ati 's relation with tsmc and its rival unite microelectronics corp. would not change .
he say ati and its supplier use the so-called cmo manufacture technology , which be different from what amd use .
umc yesterday close at nt $ 18 , up nt $ 0.05 .
some analyst however express the concern that the merger would impact tsmc in the long run , as loss of ati order would cause tsmc to see its capacity utilization lower by 20 to 30 percent .
tsmc , the world 's largest maker of customize chip , say itself monday night it will continue to manufacture for atus .
'' as part of amd , ati 's business will continue to operate in a fabless business model and maintain its strong foundry partnership with tsmc , '' the company say in a e-mail statement .
the company say it have hold discussion with ati , without provide detail .
the merger , meanwhile , be also expect to create a impact on taiwan 's chipset manufacturer .

amd to acquire microserver startup seamicro for 334 million .
february 29 , 2012 04 : 23pm est .
advanced micro device on wednesday announce a deal to acquire startup seamicro , a maker of microserver and datum center fabric technology , for 334 million .
seamicro chief executive andrew feldman will become general manager of a newly form amd business unit call datum center server solution .
seamicro lead - edge fabric technology together with amd opteron processor point the way to a compelling roadmap for the cloud datum center market , '' say lisa su , senior vice president and general manager of amd global business unit , in a discussion with reporter at the chip maker sunnyvale , calif . headquarters ahead of the announcement .
the company will continue to honor seamicro exist relationship with its own partner , su say , and will sell seamicro - branded server , which currently use server chip make by amd archrival intel .
feldman , who also speak with media wednesday , say seamicro technology be processor - agnostic , '' so incorporate amd opteron processor and even non - x86 instruction set and architecture in future product would be easy to do .
amd representative say they believe seamicro unique supercompute fabric be a major innovation in datum center technology , characterize the platform as a new server building block which would increasingly make its way into the grow cloud infrastructure space .
when you talk about the ability to tie together large amount of processor core , hundred and even thousand , within a server system , there be a lot of choice out there -lsb- in term of competitor -rsb- , particularly if you want to bring ethernet over it and disk traffic over it , there just we , '' say feldman , describe he company technology .
nobody else can move both ethernet and disk traffic , because they have very different requirement , '' he add .
feldman say seamicro suitor be numerous in the day lead up to the amd acquisition and include more than just semiconductor company .
in recent month , intel and other company have speak highly of the innovative startup .
we be fortunate that when we begin speak with amd , they have far and away the most sophisticated view on fabric , '' he say .
they have already do extensive work on what a next - generation fabric could look like .
they be kindred spirit and when you find that , you can move very quickly .
and they really move with dazzling speed . '' .
amd president and chief executive rory read also address the deal in a statement , say that the seamicro acquisition would accelerate amd transformation into a agile , disruptive innovator capable of stake a data center leadership position . '' .
amd 's ati acquisition will not affect india operation .
india will figure prominently in amd 's $ 5.4 acquisition of ati technology , as both the semiconductor giant have they operation in the country .
amd have its design centre in bangalore while ati 's r and d unit be located in hyderabad .
though the exact contour of the merger and its implication in india be not know , both be expect to maintain they exist portfolio of operation as both concentrate on different segment .
'' the combination will create a processing powerhouse by bring amd 's technology leadership in microprocessor together with ati 's strength in graphic , chipset and consumer electronics , '' amd say in a statement .
ati technology india md dasaradha r gude tell et that the combination would drive growth and the indian operation would also be expand .
'' we work be complementary to each other and do not overlap .
with this merger , we would also be able to address bigger market , '' he say .
the amd statement say , '' we can not speculate on the implication of the merger for another 90-120 day , till the time integration be complete . '' .
amd acquire seamicro -- big bet on architectural shift for server .
summary : rich fichera look at the risk and potential reward of amd recent acquisition of innovative server startup seamicro .
march 1 , 2012 - - 07 : 58 gmt -lrb- 23 : 58 pst -rrb- .
at its recent financial analyst day , amd indicate that intend to differentiate itself by create product that be advantage in niche market , with specific mention , among other segment , of server , and to generally shake up the trench warfare that have have it on the lose side of its lifelong battle with intel -lrb- my interpretation , not amd management '' s word -rrb- .
today , at least for the server side of the business they make a move that can potentially offer they visibility and differentiation by acquire innovative server startup seamicro .
seamicro have attract we attention since its appearance -lrb- blog post 1 , blog post 2 -rrb- , with its innovative architecture that dramatically reduce power and improve density by share component like i / o adapter , disk and even bio over a proprietary fabric .
the irony here be that seamicro come to market with a tight alignment with intel , who at one pint even introduce a special dual - core packaging of they atom cpu to allow seamicro improve its density and power efficiency .
most recently seamicro and intel announce a new model which feature xeon cpus to address the more mainstream segment that be not a for seamicro '' s original atom - base offering .
so what do amd hope to gain from this acquisition ?
the strategic goal be a differentiate server architecture into which they can insert amd silicon and ip .
the seamicro architecture share many of the characteristic of the calxeda / hp redstone architecture , and can potentially allow amd to produce reference architecture for its system partner to leverage that give they significant density advantage over any conventional x86 server offering .
since this architecture be initially target at dense computing environment such as those find in web 2 . 0 , cloud service provider and similar workload , as well as potentially at conventional hpc , the prospects for amd be interesting .
long - term success will hinge on several interlock factor .
1 . how much will amd focus this offering on the ultra - dense space that seamicro start address versus try to also take a bite out of the enterprise space ?
2 . how aggressively will they scale it ?
the seamicro fabric do not extend beyond the single enclosure boundary , but that appear to be a implementation decision , not a fundamental architectural issue .
my personal belief be that fabric - base server be the wave of the future , with seamicro calxeda / hp serve as very significant guideline for future development .
scale the fabric first for management and then for actual datum traffic for shared i / o and eventually for coherent memory operation if need be a natural progression .
3 . what other ip will amd add ?
amd have a interesting portfolio of gpu technology as well as cpu , and the incorporation of gpu technology could provide further differentiation in niche market .
amd have a choice of way to monetize this ip , from sell system base on its own processor -lrb- possibly as early as late this year -rrb- to provide reference design and / or license the architecture or sell component like the fabric asic .
4 . will they also support arm processor ?
if amd become the source of licensed ip for vendor want to chase hp in ultra - dense server , they can also make money by license they technology and selling component for non - x86 architecture .
5 . what will intel do ?
at least one of intel '' s partner , hp , already have a fabric - base dense server design that can support x86 .
will intel develop a similar reference architecture in the hope that they major system partner will adopt it ?
all in all , many way this could play out , but a bold move and one that may serve to trigger a rapid change in the type of server available to user over the next 24 month .

amd complete seamicro acquisition head to 9 .
amd have complete its acquisition of seamicro as part of its strategy to regain lose server market share from intel and better position itself against future competition from arm - base player such as nvidia .
we previously write on how amd can benefit from this acquisition -lrb- see amd pick up seamicro to strengthen server market offering -rrb- .
here we take a brief look at the price that amd pay for seamicro , and what this imply about its growth expectation .
amd shell out 334 million for the acquisition of seamicro .
since seamicro '' s revenue or other financial be not disclose , it become difficult to gauge whether the price pay be cheap or steep .
however , base on certain assumption , it be possible to understand the range of amd '' be growth expectation from seamicro .
for the purpose of calculation , we assume that seamicro operate at ebitda margin of close to 25 and apply similar corporate expense -lrb- as % of revenue -rrb- include tax , capital expenditure and other that we apply for amd .
if we assume seamicro '' s revenue for 2012 will be somewhere around 50 million , it imply that amd expect seamicro '' s revenue to grow at a average annual rate of 43 to 44 over the course of we forecast period , which extend till 2018 .
these revenue include both seamicro '' be revenue as well as incremental benefit in server - related revenue from the acquisition .
on the other hand , if we assume seamicro '' s revenue for 2012 to be of the order of 150 million , it imply that amd '' be growth expectation for seamicro and related incremental server revenue stand at somewhere around 16 to 17 .
accord to amd '' be own calculation , it have pay a handsome price for the acquisition .
we price estimate for amd stand at 9 . 21 , imply a premium of little under 15 to the market price .
hp to acquire datum center consultant .
on november 13 , 2007 .
electronics manufacturer hewlett - packard -lrb- hp . com -rrb- announce on tuesday that it have sign a definitive agreement to acquire eyp mission critical facility -lrb- eypmcf . com -rrb- , a consult company that specialize in strategic technology planning , design and operation support for large - scale datum center .
although no financial term of the transaction be disclose , it be expect to be complete within hp '' s first fiscal quarter .
by acquire eyp mcf , hp will be able to help customer to better transform they datum center , optimize energy efficiency and position they for future business growth , say the company .
headquarter in new york , eyp mcf have approximately 350 employee with 13 office in the we and the uk .
the firm provide mission - critical service to enterprise around the world in business sector include financial service , telecommunications , technology , broadcast , manufacturing and healthcare , as well as numerous federal , state and county government agency .
hp say that eyp mcf '' s capability , particularly its expertise in energy - efficient operation , complement hp '' s extensive datum center service and cost - save power and cool solution , such as dynamic smart cooling .
'' the datum center be the foundation of it for enterprise , a essential building block for drive business growth and adapt to change business objective , '' say john mccain , senior vice president and general manager , hp service .
'' acquire eyp mission critical facility boost hp '' s ability to help customer transform they datum center and build dynamic computing environment from the ground up . '' .

hewlett - packard corp . -lrb- nyse : hpq -rrb- have open up its checkbook once again .
this time , the world largest tech company by sale announce that it will be buy eyp mission critical facility inc .
that company , which provide datum center consulting service , will become a division of hp for a undisclosed sum , accord to source .
be this a move to compete more headily with tech giant ibm corp . -lrb- nyse : ibm -rrb- ?
it could certainly be see that way .
hp grow presence in provide datum center service and contract consulting be the core of ibm business model these day , now that the latter be out of the hardware business .
eyp provide design , technology planning and support for large datum center - - the kind that run a large u . s . bank , credit card operation or manufacturing business .
this be right in ibm territory , and the move should put hp in a more competitive position to challenge ibm as a premier provider of compute service consult .

over time , fewer supplier mean move from the large buy the small - and medium - size to the large munch on the large , more merger of near equal , carve up the market into fewer fiefdom within the complex bound of global regulatory approval .
it could happen in two or three year if the right alignment of player occur , '' he add .

hp say the acquisition will boost its ability to help client improve they datum centre and build new computing environment .
the deal be expect to close in january 2008 .
can ed remain vendor-neutral under hp s thumb ?
will ed remain open-minded about obtain product and service from other vendor ?
industry analyst contact by eweek generally say they believe that hewlett-packard 's forthcoming $ 13.9 billion acquisition of electronic datum system ? announce officially on may 13 be a good move for both company , although there will be the usual integration snafus over vendor neutrality issue , business line , culture shock and layoff .
analyst have also say it be a good move overall for customer and potential customer , because the combined company will offer they a greater palette of product and service from which to choose .
a combined hp-ed will certainly put a new kind of pressure on it service leader ibm .
ibm 's $ 54 billion-per-year global service arm-by far the largest in the world-will start to feel the heat from the combined hp-eds entity , which will start out at a net worth of $ 38 billion per year .
for high-end enterprise it service before this merger , the market consist of ibm and everybody else .
it swiss army knife be all can opener .
the biggest unanswered question on people 's mind involve vendor neutrality for ed and its current customer .
ed for year be a sort of it swiss army knife in that it use whatever product and service from other vendor be need to complete its job correctly and within budget constraint .
with its impending new ownership by one of those key vendor , that picture may change .
'' we do not know what will happen with ed ' vendor neutrality , '' rick sturm , founder and president of enterprise management associate , tell eweek .
overall , my take be that this transaction sound great in theory , but there many potential pitfall .
this be one of they .
for example , ed have largely standardized on management software from can .
will they migrate to hp software now ?
that would take a long time and a lot of money , '' sturm say .
'' on the other hand , it do not make sense to help support a competitor with license and maintenance fee .
that be just one small point regard neutrality . '' .
ed , in fact , have a large current contract with can for network and system management in direct competition to hp 's openview .
can have no immediate comment may 13 .
at least initially , sturm say , there will be little noticeable impact on customer from the deal .
'' there will probably be some service impact once the organization truly merge and consolidate resource , '' he say .
'' -lsb- hp cio -rsb- randy mott have be drive datum center consolidation and standardization .
i expect that effort will be renew with ed .
disruption be inevitable with such migration . '' .

hp acquisition of eyp be subject to certain closing condition and be expect to be complete within hp first fiscal quarter .
hp dig further into consulting .
november 12 , 2007 10 : 30 pm .
hp have be move fast and strong into service and have continue the trend with today acquisition of eyp mission critical facility , a consulting firm specialize in large datum center design and operation support .
come on the heel of last month expansion of they saas offering , one imagine that before long you will simply be able to turn you key over to hp and take off on a long vacation while they provision , support , and run you business .
in fact , this may not be far from the vision that ceo mark hurd have for the company , as reveal today also during he keynote speech at oracle openworld conference .
consolidation have clearly be on he mind , and the recent acquisition presage more in the future , drive as he state by '' ... a push from a it perspective to do more standardization and to have fewer supplier , '' as well as a number of player with a excess of cash on hand .
while i be certainly one of those push from the it perspective to have fewer supplier and more standardization , you have to be careful how you go about it , and although i be sure acquisition such as eyp mcf be brilliant for hp business , i be skeptical about they value to customer .
i think the conflation of purveyor of advice with purveyor of service and equipment be dangerous and if anyone be expect to get unbiased opinion out of eyp mcf about the gear to build out they datum center with , that probably go by the wayside .
consolidation can be a boon when it result in better alignment and firmer standard ; the danger be when the alignment lock you in to a vendor and the standard turn out to be proprietary .

scott peterson have be find guilty of first-degree murder , a verdict that mean he could be execute if these same juror vote as the '' conscience of they community '' that he deserve to die for he crime .

expect by many to be one of the top team in the eastern conference , the 76er have open 9-14 with eight loss in they last 10 game , include friday 's dispirited 88-72 setback at cleveland .
cheek be replace on a interim basis by assistant general manager tony dileo , a long-time member of the team 's front office dileo will coach the sixer in saturday 's game at washington and be expect to remain coach for the rest of the season .
a year ago , the sixer fire president billy king and replace he with ed stefanskus , who give cheek a one-year contract extension through the 2008-09 season and another one-year extension earlier this year , after philadelphia use a second-half surge to make the playoff for the first time since 2005 .
'' decision of this nature be never easy , and this be particularly difficult due to the great amount of respect i have for maurice cheek , '' stefanskus say .
'' however , at this time i feel that it be in the best interest of this team to make a change while there be still time to accomplish the goal we set forth for ourselves at the start of the season . '' .
in the off-season , stefanski land free agent forward elton brand and reinked young star andre iguodala and loui william to long term deal .
the addition of brand be suppose to transform philadelphia into a contender .
however , brand and iguodala have have difficulty get they game to mesh .
cheek have have disagreement with start centre samuel dalembert , bench he for long stretch .
the team hear boo in wednesday 's home loss to cleveland .
a philadelphia fixture who spend he first 11 season as a player with the 76er and have he number-10 jersey retire by the club , cheek be 122-147 in three-plus season as head coach in the city of brotherly love .
cheek come to philadelphia from portland , where he be 162-139 with two postseason appearance in three-plus season .
dileo have never be a nba coach .

dileo play and coach for 10 season in west germany and be name coach of the year in 1987 in the top west german league .
'' tony dileo have a wealth of basketball knowledge and coaching experience - both in the nba and on the international level - and be familiar not only with we current group of player but the style of play we be strive to attain on a consistent basis , '' stefanskus say .
cheek be the fifth coach fire this season , after pj carlesimo of oklahoma city , eddie jordan of washington , sam mitchell of toronto and randy wittman of minnesota .
there be speculation that stefanski may reach out to jordan , as the two work together with the new jersey net earlier this decade .

cheek have sign a extension to he contract in september that be guarantee through next year but the club feel they need to make a change to reverse they fortune .
assistant general manager tony dileo will replace cheek as the interim head coach and he be expect to hold the position through the year .
philadelphia fan have expect the 76er to be a contender this year follow a playoff appearance one year ago and then add brand .
never before in nba history have coach fall this early in the season in such number .
now , maurice cheek become the nba 's fifth coaching casualty of the season .
on saturday , cheek be fire as head coach of the philadelphia 76er .
with the off-season acquisition of elton brand , the 2008-09 season be suppose to be a good one for the sixer .
unfortunately , it have not play out that way to date .
despite lead the team in score , brand have not yet live up to expectation and the rest of the team also have struggle .
the sixer have a record of 9-14 and have be expect to be a playoff contender in the eastern conference .
accord to the associated press , the dismissal come hour before the 76er be to play at home saturday night , with dileo now make he coaching debut against washington .
dileo have spend 19 season with the 76er .
he be promote to senior vice president/assistant general manager in 2003 .
cheek be one of more the popular player in 76er history and be start he fourth season as coach .
gm ed stefanskus have give cheek two contract extension in the past season , but the slow start be enough to cost he he job .
philadelphia 76er management have enough of the nba team lurk near the bottom of the eastern conference standing and fire head coach maurice cheek on saturday .

the 76er drop they third game in a row on friday , a 88-72 setback to cleveland , and occupy last place in the atlantic division with a 9-14 record .
cheek would become the fifth nba coach fire this season , along with p.j. carlesimo -lrb- oklahoma city -rrb- , eddie jordan -lrb- washington -rrb- , sam mitchell -lrb- toronto -rrb- and randy wittman -lrb- minnesota -rrb- .
the former 76er point guard for much of the 1980s come back to the city to assume coaching duty prior to the 2005 season .
last season he lead the club to they first postseason berth in four year .
cheek have a overall record of 284-286 , which include nearly four year as coach of portland .
stefanski have give cheek two contract extension in the past season , but the slow start be enough to cost he he job .
the sixer have hardly resemble last season 's up-tempo group that advance to the playoff , despite the addition of free agent elton brand .
dileo have spend 19 season with the 76er and be promote to senior vice president and assistant general manager in 2003 .
prior to join the organization he have amateur coaching experience .
philadelphia host the washington wizard on saturday .
the philadelphia 76er fire coach maurice cheek saturday morning after a disappointing 9-14 start to the 2008-09 season .
the sixer have a three-game losing streak go into saturday night 's contest against washington , and more have be expect from a team that sign free-agent forward elton brand to a five-year , $ 80 million contract in the off-season .
'' i make the decision because i feel we be not progress the way we want to progress , '' say general manager ed stefanskus at a news conference .
'' i feel on the floor we be not execute the philosophy that we want to have as sixer basketball . '' .
stefanski say tony dileo , the team 's assistant general manager and senior vice president , will coach the team the rest of this season .
exclude brand 's 15.9 point and 10 rebound , the team 's star have not play up to past standard .
andre miller be average 15.5 point per game , andre iguodala 14.9 point , a drop of five point per game from last season , while samuel dalembert be down almost five point per game with he 5.8 point and just over two rebound .
cheek compile a 162-139 record in three-plus season and coach the 76er to 40 regular-season victory in 2007-08 before a six-game loss to detroit in the eastern conference quarterfinal .
he be the fifth nba head coach fire this season , join oklahoma city 's p.j.carlesimo , washington 's eddie jordan , toronto 's sam mitchell and minnesota 's randy wittman .
maurice cheek be out as philadelphia 76er head coach .
general manager ed stefanskus announce tony dileo , the team 's assistant general manager and senior vice president , will take over as the head coach for the remainder of the season .
stefanski fire cheek with the sixer flounder at 9-14 and in the basement of the eastern conference 's atlantic division .
as recently as a season ago , when speak about cheek ' new contract extension , stefanski say , '' we be excite about the future under this direction . '' .
that change dramatically on saturday .
'' i make the decision because i feel we be not progress the way we want to progress , '' say stefanski .
'' i feel on the floor we be not execute the philosophy that we want to have as sixer basketball .
i tell mo we need to go in a different direction and make a change .
he be very gracious about it .
he be a sixer and be root for we to turn this around . '' .
this past offseason , the sixer bolster they youthful , athletic roster with frontline cornerstone elton brand , who be lead the team in score -lrb- 15.9 -rrb- and rebound -lrb- 10.0 -rrb- but be significantly short of he career score average and have already miss time this season due to injury .
the expectation be high for a team that win 40 game and take detroit to six game in the eastern conference quarterfinal round last season .
cheek do not meet they .
friday night 's 88-72 loss in cleveland , the team 's eighth in 10 game , be apparently the last straw cheek be the fifth nba head coach to be fire this season .
'' i believe in this team .
we be better than this , '' say stefanski .
'' we be go to make it better .
we will find a way to improve on this team '' .
the member of the sixer ' 1982-83 nba championship team start he head coaching career in portland , where he finish with a 162-139 mark and a pair of playoff appearance .

but in evaluate the season , king say he do think the sixer be head in the right direction .
he have a problem with the team style of play , which include reliance on the three - point basket and a defense that protect the paint but have trouble get out on perimeter shooter .
there be also talk that o'brien be aloof and not communicative with he player .
he do not start samuel dalembert , a develop young center , until the season 19th game , and he do not play willie green with iverson for much of the season final four month because he feel that be a bad matchup defensively .
king say that in he postseason meeting with player , not one of they say they would play for jim ... ... ...

'' i feel we be not progress the way we have want to progress , '' stefanskus say .
'' i do not feel on the floor we be execute the philosophy we want to have as sixer basketball . '' .
cheek be one of more the popular player in 76er history and be start he fourth season as coach stefanski have give cheek two contract extension in the past season , but the slow start be enough to cost he he job .
cheek become the fifth nba coach fire this season follow p.j. carlesimo -lrb- oklahoma city -rrb- , eddie jordan -lrb- washington -rrb- , sam mitchell -lrb- toronto -rrb- and randy wittman -lrb- minnesota -rrb- .

'' this catch we by surprise .
we have no idea . '' .
dileo say he have not talk to he father yet , but notice one miss call from he on he cell phone .
cheek lead the 76er to the playoff last year for the first time while he be coach .
philadelphia be one of the surprise team in the east last season , and the 76er anticipate a deep run in the playoff this year .
they sign elton brand to a five-year deal worth nearly $ 80 million last summer , but they have struggle with he in the lineup and have lose eight of 10 .
last season , the 76er lose in the first round to detroit .
after a 18-30 start , philadelphia win 18 of its next 23 game and wind up at 40-42 , the sixth seed in the eastern conference .
stefanski reward cheek with two contract extension in seven month that would have take he to the end of next season .
instead , with the team on a three-game losing streak and last in the atlantic division , he do not even last until the end of the calendar year .
cheek also coach at portland .
he play 15 season in the nba , the first 11 with philadelphia , and retire in 1993 .
a outstanding defensive player , cheek play in four all-star game and be a member of the 76er ' championship team in 1982-83 .
he no. 10 jersey hang in the rafter .
mo cheek will take over as new coach .
update : may 24 , 2005 , 3 : 23 pm et .
maurice cheek be run the show again for the philadelphia 76er .
in a surprising move nearly three week follow the end of they season , the sixer fire jim o'brien on monday after one season as coach and replace he with cheek , one of the most popular player in franchise history .
mo be family .
mo bleed 76er . he bleed philadelphia , '' team president billy king say .
cheek will be introduce as philadelphia 21st head coach at a tuesday news conference .
philadelphia be certainly bank on the former point guard to have a happier homecoming than o'brien , a philadelphia native who play for saint joseph .
o'brien stubbornness and seemingly unwavering belief in a system that do fit he player cost he he job despite a 43 - 39 record and a return to the playoff .
i just feel the direction we be go and the overall play be where we want to go , '' king say .
o'brien just finish the first year of a three - year deal that include a option and pay he about 4 million a year .
o'brien , though , be not very popular with he player - - most notably former all - star chris webber - - who often complain about they role .
king say after the sixer be eliminate in the first round of the playoff by detroit that he plan to bring o'brien back .
after meet with he player and other member of management , king have a change of heart and decide over the weekend he have to make a change .
certainly , king know a thing or two about make change - - cheek will be the fifth sixer coach in four year under he watch .
larry brown left for detroit follow the 2002 - 03 season , and assistant randy ayer be promote and fire 52 game into the 2003 - 04 season before he be replace by chris ford .
i know this thing be come , and it be a easy thing for anybody , '' brown say from miami before coaching the piston in the eastern conference final .
know billy , it not easy to let a coach go .
he relationship with randy be pretty strong .
i think it be hard for he to let chri go .
he be excite about have jimmy , but i not think it ever get easy . '' .
cheek be one of the most popular 76er from 1978 - 89 and play on philadelphia last championship team in 1983 .
he also spend seven season as a assistant coach for the 76er , be part of the staff under brown when they go to the nba final in 2001 and develop a strong bond with allen iverson .
cheek be fire march 2 after nearly four season as coach of the trail blazer .
he have a 162 - 139 record in portland , the fourth - highest win total in blazer history .
cheek guide the team to the playoff he first two season , but the player hardly make cheek tenure easy - - on or off the court .
the team be nickname the jail blazer after several brush with the law , many of they involve marijuana possession .
if player have problem with mo cheek ... ... ... then there get to be something wrong with those player , '' king say .
but cheek return to the city where he be a four - time all - star should come as a surprise .
the trail blazer turn down philadelphia request to speak to cheek as a possible replacement for brown , but the former point guard always remain popular with philly fan and be at the top of the sixer short list to take over for ford .
now , they get they wish .
we do not want to change coach -lsb- again -rsb- , '' sixer chairman ed snider say .
have see enough coach . '' .
the sixer will pay ayer , o'brien and cheek next season .
i not think it something be very proud of , but i not think it reflect poorly , '' snider say .
o'brien be the son - in - law of hall of fame coach jack ramsay .
he lead the sixer to a 10 - win improvement from a year ago and they return to the playoff , largely on the back of a healthy , happy iverson .
while o'brien avoid public spat with iverson , he do not have the full support of the rest of the team .
some of the younger player , like samuel dalembert and willie green , feel they do not develop like they should have under o'brien and be unsure about they role .
in look at the development of some of they , yeah , i be pleased , '' king say .
the sixer also fail to really understand o'brien defense , a sticking point even in the postseason .
some of the criterion on we defense be there , '' king say .
cheek , who once famously come to the rescue of a 13 - year - old girl who forget the word to the national anthem before a playoff game , now hope to bail out he former team and bring they another championship .
mo have play this game here in philadelphia , win a championship here in philadelphia , understand player , understand defens , understand the way i think we want to play , '' king say .

cheek will be replace on a interim basis by sixer senior vice president and assistant general manager tony dileo , who will remain in the position through the end of the 2008-09 season .
'' decision of this nature be never easy , and this be particularly difficult due to the great amount of respect i have for maurice cheek , '' stefanskus say .
'' however , at this time i feel that it be in the best interest of this team to make a change while there be still time to accomplish the goal we set forth for ourselves at the start of the season .
'' tony dileo have a wealth of basketball knowledge and coaching experience - both in the nba and on the international level - and be familiar not only with we current group of player but the style of play we be strive to attain on a consistent basis . '' .
dileo be in he 19th season with the sixer organization and be in he fifth as the team 's senior vice president and assistant general manager .
during he tenure with the sixer , dileo have be involve in every aspect of the team 's basketball operation .
in he role as senior vice president and assistant general manager , dileo be responsible for assist stefanskus with player procurement via he evaluation of amateur and professional talent while supervise the team 's draft effort and oversee the college and professional scout system .
prior to that , dileo spend four season as the sixer director of player personnel -lrb- 1999-2003 -rrb- and have serve as a assistant coach under larry brown , jim lynam , fred carter , john luca and doug moe .
dileo have extensive experience in international basketball as both a player and a coach .
he coach the former west german man 's and woman 's team from 1979-90 , win nine national title in that country 's top division , earn coach of the year honor in 1987 .
additionally , he be select as the west german federation national coach from 1981-85 and during that time , write and publish the european basketball handbook , a guide design to acclimate american player overseas .
a star at cinnaminson -lrb- n.j. -rrb- high school , dileo go on to play at tennessee tech and lasalle university , where as a junior he be name first-team academic all-american and go on to graduate maximum cum laude from the lasalle school of business .
cheek be name the 21st head coach in team history on may 23 , 2005 .
in just over three season at the helm for philadelphia , cheek compile a mark of 122-147 -lrb- .454 -rrb- .
last season , cheek guide the sixer to the nba playoff for the first time since the 2004-05 season , after start the year with a 18-30 record .
the sixer go on to win 18 of they next 23 game , become just the sixth team in nba history to go over .500 after be at least 12 game below .500 at some point during the same season .
in 2006-07 , cheek help rally the sixer from a 5-19 start to make a push for the playoff with a 35-47 record .
philadelphia increase they winning percentage to .519 in game play after january 1 , compare to a win percentage of just .267 during the first two month of the year - the biggest improvement by any team in the league during that span .
the sixer also tie for the eighth best win percentage after the all-star break -lrb- 18-11 ; .621 -rrb- .
in he first season as head coach of the sixer , cheek guide the team to a 38-44 mark and fall just two win shy of reach the post-season .
on april 18 of that year , he earn the 200th win of he coaching career .
cheek record as a nba head coach with both portland and philadelphia stand at 284-286 -lrb- .498 -rrb- .
philadelphia 76er fire jim o'brien , coach . name maurice cheek coach .
not because mo cheek be long for the job with the philadelphia 76er .
like all coach not in the upper stratosphere of the coaching hierarchy -- you phil jackson and gregg popovich -- he be only as good as he last 10-game stretch , only as secure as how well he star be play .
but the 76er , while underachieve at 9-14 when cheek be fire saturday morning , be not a embarassment when they go on the court , not a disjointed bunch that clearly be no longer listen to or play for its coach .
this be not p.j. carlesimo -lrb- oklahoma city -rrb- or eddie jordan -lrb- washington -rrb- , whose team 's putrid won-loss record sink any chance they have of survival .
this be not sam mitchell -lrb- toronto -rrb- , whose difference of opinion with he general manager about he team 's personnel be too big to overcome .
this be not randy wittman -lrb- minnesota -rrb- , whose fan base be stay away in drove as the pay public grow indifferent to the on-court product .
the timing of this move by team president and general manager ed stefanski be a head-scratcher .
'' it be not 100 percent on the coach , '' a source with knowledge of the 76er ' thinking say saturday afternoon .
'' but at the same time , we do not seem to have a plan . '' .
stefanski name assistant general manager tony dileo coach for the rest of the season .
dileo have a good reputation as a coach , spending time over the last two decade on the sixer ' bench as a assistant and in europe as a head coach .
but unless circumstance change dramatically , jordan -- who become close with stefanski while both be in new jersey earlier this decade -- will be the odds-on favorite to get the job permanantly .
many league exec still think quite highly of jordan , and none of the player who matter in washington throw jordan under the bus after he be fire .
cheek ' coaching move have frequently be criticize over the year , both in philadelphia and in portland .
but he lose he job this time not only because of xs and os , but because so many of the 76er ' player that blossom under he last season , include center sam dalembert , forward andre iguodala and guard lou william , struggle to get go this season .
and the move cheek make , like bench second-year forward thaddeus young and elevate guard willie green , have not produce enough dividend .
'' ed just be not see any progress , '' the source say , and stefanski expect more from a team that have sign free agent elton brand to a $ 82 million deal and re-signed core player iguodala and william for $ 80 million and $ 25 million , respectively .
'' we be not progress at the rate -lsb- stefanski -rsb- think we should , and he think it be time for a move , '' the source say .
yet stefanskus can not escape criticism , either .
bring brand in be the signing coup of the nba offseason , to be sure .
but in do that , stefanski change the team 's footprint .
the sixer be still a very good transition team .
but when the game slow down , have to cater to brand leave the lane clog .
last season , iguodala , young and william have drive room when philly run its halfcourt set , and dalembert show occasional decent low-post play .
but now , brand be the man in the paint , force everyone else out on the perimeter .
leave to fend for himself on the weakside , dalembert 's number have plummet , and william have just begin to play well .
brand be recover from the achille ' injury that keep he out of all but eight game last season with the clipper , but he be be slow by a bad hamstring , and he offensive number -lrb- 15.9 point , a career-low .436 from the floor -rrb- have be unspectactular .
no matter what the stats say , philly look and play slower this season .
and stefanski do not get a big-time shooter who could stretch the court and take pressure off of brand inside .
veteran donyell marshall and kareem rush , sign later in the summer by philly , do not strike much fear into oppose team .
the result be philly 's 93.3 score average , 28th in the league -lrb- only charlotte and oklahoma city have score 100 point fewer time than philadelphia 's six -rrb- , and .314 percentage behind the three-point line , 26th in the league .
'' everybody zone they , '' a eastern conference executive say saturday .
the sixer have just score one of they more impressive victory eight day ago , rally from a double-digit deficit in the second half to win on the road at detroit .
true , they have bad loss early to the bobcat and timberwolve , and lose a home-and-home to the cavalier on wednesday and friday .
but last we check , cleveland be 20-3 , owner of a 11-game win streak and the only remain undefeated team at home this season .
the cav be roll , and lose to they be no embarassment .
another league source with knowledge of the team 's thinking say saturday that the cleveland loss play no role in cheek 's firing .
cheek receive he second one-year contract extension in less than a year last september , take he through the 2009-10 season .
while stefanski do not hire cheek -lrb- that be former president billy king , whom stefanski replace early last season -rrb- , stefanski and cheek have quickly establish a solid , work relationship with one another .
cheek quickly acquiesce last year when stefanski ask he to give more time to the team 's younger player , get young and young vet rodney carney and william bigger minute .
the transition transform the team , as the 76er go on a 19-7 run last spring , turn opponent over and become deadly in transition .
they ride they hot streak into the playoff , where they stretch detroit to six game before succumb in the first round .
they be not a finish product , though , and it be no secret that brand be stefanski 's target , just as he would be king 's ultimate target .
after a brief dalliance with atlanta free agent josh smith , so stefanski clear as much cap room as possible , send carney and center calvin booth to minnesota , and then strike , get brand to spurn he former team , the clipper , as well as the warrior , for the sixer ' $ 80 million offer -- the '' philly max , '' as brand later call it .
after keep iguodala and william , all the heat be on cheek .
saturday , he become the latest coach -- one-sixth of the league 's head man already go in little more than five week -- to succumb to the pyre .

you fail 1.5 time in today 's nba , you might be do for a while cheek be smooth and well-liked , so he could get a gig soon enough .
but it seem more likely that he would get back on the bench as a assistant or move to a college program .

with its acquisition of free agent elton brand the lineup seem to be become more solid especially in the middle .
but brand have not find he rhythm in the offense and he number have be disappointing .
some have say that instead of be the miss piece , that not unlike the phoenix sun , the team have miss its run and gun offense from last season .
when philly land a playoff spot near the bottom of the east 's pile this past spring and then surprise the piston by take the first two game from they in detroit before lose the next four straight , there be high hope for .500 + season and a upgrade in the playoff seeding .
with brand 's arrival the hope turn into what fan think be a reality .
never before in nba history have coach fall this early in the season in such number .
veteran player know all too well that the security they union have fight for have create a imbalance of power on team that do not have a proven winner in the coaching seat .
when a player be pay ten of million of dollar by a franchise , he be in the driver 's seat and if it come down to a contest between that player and a coach who have not win a title or have not win a title in a long while , it be not hard to know who have to go .

there be no doubt that ross be instrumental in make ` the hunger game '' a huge success .
it be he direction that many critic applaud and bring the film down to earth , as oppose to the bloated spectacle it could have become in the wrong hand .
lionsgate can '' t hide that they don '' t have the money , but they have to spend it wisely to ensure the quality of the franchise continue and ross could get a good deal out of it .
of course , if ross want too much money lionsgate could easily give he the flick and hire a new director similar to the ` harry potter '' and ` twilight '' film .
consider lionsgate recently absorb summit and they executive -lrb- master of the ` twilight '' film -rrb- into team lionsgate ; a change in director could be likely .
another tough challenge face lionsgate with the production of ` catch fire '' be the possibility of delay due to the schedule of lawrence .
` catch fire '' have a release date of 22 november 2013 with production start later in the year .
lawrence be set to star in the sequel to ` x - man : first class '' that could go into production soon if fox decide to exercise lawrence '' s option to do the sequel .

chris weitz be in negotiation to helm '' new moon , '' the sequel to summit entertainment 's vampire breakout '' twilight . '' .
weitz come on board to helm the second installment in stephenie meyer 's four-book series after summit and '' twilight '' director catherine hardwicke fail to reach a deal on the new movie .
the weitz move prompt a carefully calibrate campaign of reassurance on the part of creator .
meyer pen a letter that seek to calm fan nervous about the midstream switch .
'' i be sad that catherine be not continue on with we for new moon , ' she write in a letter on she web site , but then note that , with weitz .
'' torch and pitchfork be not go to be necessary . '' .
the director '' be excite by the story and eager to keep the movie as close to the book as possible , '' she write .
'' he be also aware of you , the fan , and want to keep you all extremely happy .
it be rare for the director of a successful first picture not to continue on with the sequel .
there have be conflict report about hardwicke 's departure , with some note creative and other difference .
summit have say it be a matter of scheduling .
weitz have not helm a girl-oriented project before but have be involve in movie that encompass element feature in '' twilight , '' produce the teen-aimed coming-of-age tale '' american pie '' and direct the fantasy adventure '' the golden compass . '' .
still , the director be take few chance .
'' i promise to remain responsive to you hope and fear , '' he write in he own letter to fan saturday .
'' i thank you for this opportunity and for you faith . '' .
weitz say he have be '' in a whirlwind romance '' with the series over the past few day , and , in a particularly careful phrasing , say he be '' very grateful to have receive -lrb- meyer 's -rrb- permission to protect new moon ' in its translation from the page to the screen . '' .
both weitz 's and meyer 's letter represent rare attempt to communicate with fan on issue often leave mostly to the industry , and speak both to the intense insider interest of fan as well as the importance of that group to the franchise 's success .
summit a week ago have face a public-relations challenge when some fan bulletin board begin to worry about hardwicke 's departure .
robert pattinson and kristen stewart will star in '' moon , '' while melissa rosenberg be write the picture which , like the first , center on the ordinary teenager bella and the vampire edward but add jacob , a werewolf character who figure less prominently in the first film .
the budget for '' moon '' be expect to be slightly higher than the first in the franchise , with a release likely for late 2009 or early 2010 .
the hunger game director gary ross still in negotiation for the sequel .
publish : 2012 - 04 - 04 11 : 47 : 35 .
during the promotional period for the hunger game everyone involve make sure to note how different the franchise be from twilight .
while it may have seem like a silly thing to do give twilight success , but the truth be that comparison be make male audience a bit shaky about the film , as that demographic do want to spend two and a half hour watch a tween romance -lrb- and hunger game be definitely not that -rrb- .
the film obviously be hurt by this strategy , as it go on to shatter record and become the third highest gross open weekend title of all time .
but while the story of the hunger game may have no comparison to twilight , it turn out that action behind the scene may duplicate it .
while the first movie be a huge success , thr be say that director gary ross be still in negotiation to direct the sequel , catch fire .
the star of the film - the one that survive , anyway - be already contractually obligate to appear in the second movie , but thing have be go to great on the filmmaker side .
the trade say that ross negotiation with lionsgate the first time around be so hot either , a inside source call it a terrible experience , '' as the studio do usually pay seasoned - filmmaker fee to even seasoned filmmaker like ross . ?
because of the hunger game big box office number , ross be expect a raise for he work on the movie -lrb- he be give 3 million upfront and 5 on the backend with he first deal -rrb- but it unclear if the studio will give it to he .
much like the twilight franchise , or even harry potter , it entirely possible that lionsgate will choose not to pay ross and instead go with another filmmaker who be demand less money .
a script have already be write for catch fire , from simon beaufoy , but ross have not yet have the chance to revise it .
the one big card that ross have in he back pocket be that the hunger game be better receive than any of the twilight film , which could convince the brass to try and keep some consistency .
whether it will play in he favor be still a unknown at this point .
so what do you think ?
should ross be bring back for the next movie or should they go with someone else vision ?
leave you thought , idea and desire in the comment section below .
it be official : chris weitz be take over the director 's chair for the '' twilight '' sequel '' new moon . '' .
'' twilight '' author stephenie meyer confirm the news on she official website saturday morning in a post design to calm the rise anguish among fan who love the first film adaptation .
after bid a fond farewell to '' twilight '' director catherine hardwicke , meyer go on to praise weitz and to let fan know that '' torch and pitchfork be not go to be necessary . '' .
on the one hand , weitz have show he skill at adapt popular modern novel for the screen -- '' about a boy , '' from the nick hornby novel , win weitz and co-scripter paul weitz and peter hedge a oscar nomination for best adapt screenplay .
on the other hand , weitz also direct last year 's '' the golden compass , '' which be a expensive mess that fail to capture the fan base of the book .
director gary ross still in negotiation for hunger game sequel , catch fire ; release date may be in jeopardy .
post 1 year , 160 day ago -lsb- download on 2 october 2013 -rsb- .
as i say many time in my review , gary ross ` direction be the strongest element of the hunger game .
but for lionsgate , the movie '' s ability to make a crazy amount of money be the strongest element of the hunger game .
now , thr be report that ross and the studio be lock in tense negotiation over he return to direct the sequel , catch fire .
lead actor jennifer lawrence , josh hutcherson , and liam hemsworth be already sign for catch fire -lrb- and i imaging they '' re also sign for the third installment , mockingjay -rrb- , but ross doesn '' t have a deal in place .
he be pay 3 million for co - write and direct the film plus 5 percent on the back - end .
unsurprisingly , he would like a raise on the sequel .
hit the jump for more include why catch fire might not make its november 22 , 2013 release date .
accord to thr , negotiation on the first film be tough because ross already have a successful , oscar - nominate movie to he name -lrb- seabiscuit -rrb- , but lionsgate have never pay a hefty filmmaker salary before -lrb- hunger game be the highest - budget project in the studio '' s history -rrb- .
now that hunger game will undoubtedly be one of the highest - gross film of the year , ross have some leverage , but current franchise trend aren '' t move in he favor .
other major franchise have show no hesitation in constantly switch out director .
after all , it '' be the title that draw people into the theater , not the filmmaker .
harry potter go through four director as do twilight , and marvel have basically make it a policy never to rehire any of they director .
the studio '' s highest priority be make sure to keep the franchise flow without delay , and prolonged negotiation with ross may cause a delay .
there '' s also the add problem of ross take time to revise simon beaufoy ` be script for catch fire .
lionsgate be also face a issue with the sequel '' s schedule november 22 , 2013 release date .
fox could stymie lionsgate '' s plan by exercise lawrence '' s option to do the sequel for x - man : first class .
source tell thr that fox '' s option would take priority over lionsgate '' s .
lionsgate be aim to get catch fire into production by the fall , but fox already have they director ready to go -lrb- matthew vaughn be sign to return for first class 2 -rrb- .
however , first class 2 doesn '' t have a release date .
ross '' do have a few counter against lionsgate .
first , he '' be a known quantity and have establish a relationship with the cast and crew .
he also deliver a critically well - receive movie .
grant , the hunger game would have crush at the box office no matter what , but the positive response indicate that he '' s now in higher demand for other property .
it '' be a impressive boost for a director who hadn '' t helm a project since seabiscuit in 2003 .
despite the acrimony , a source tell thr that the two side will eventually make a deal .
ultimately , it will be difficult , and yet everybody will do the sane thing , which be to work it out , '' say one .
'' everybody will end up unhappy in they own way .
it '' be just the nature of the beast . '' .
the alternative be to throw 24 director into a arena and have they fight to the death .
and if you '' be have trouble imagine other director take over the franchise , take a look at these fake poster for the hunger game .

-lrb- and summit rob friedman and patrick wachsberger now run lionsgate film division . -rrb- .
but ross will argue that he film be much better receive than any in the twilight series , with a a cinemascore and a 85 percent fresh rating on rotten tomato in addition to huge worldwide box office .

will also earn five percent of the backend gross , a significant number since game have already accumulate 459 million around the globe .
per thr , the negotiation between the two party be delicate , '' but a deal could get do soon .
after all , catch fire begin shooting in august with a script from oscar winner simon beaufoy -lrb- slumdog millionaire -rrb- .
well '' new moon '' have a new director .
and it be a man .
chris weitz will take on the sequel to '' twilight '' .
chris weitz the director of '' the golden compass '' and best know for he work with he brother paul on '' american pie '' be step up to do '' new moon '' .
weitz have a good relationship with summit studio and be easy to work with .
he also have experience with special effect .
of course though it be not official yet december 14th the announcement will be make for the hire decision .
just in time to start the pre-production detail for this highly anticipate sequel .
'' twilight '' have gross more than 141 million already .
gary ross remain in negotiation to direct the hunger game sequel .
wednesday , 04 april 2012 10 : 30 .
after open to the third - biggest domestic debut weekend of all time , legitimate pop culture phenomenon the hunger game have gross 368 . 0 million globally .
it do so in under two week of theatrical release .
so with by far the biggest hit in its history , lionsgate be naturally keen to continue the series with catch fire , the already announce adaptation of suzanne collin novel .
but apparently it not a guarantee that gary ross , who co - write and direct the hunger game , will be back for another round .
lionsgate have long be open about its intent to turn collin bestsell young adult novel into a franchise , one that would spin four movie out of the literary trilogy .
last year , the studio stake out a november 22 , 2013 release date for catch fire and pursued oscar win slumdog millionaire screenwriter simon beaufoy to pen the script .
in january , word emerge that beaufoy be indeed at work on catch fire , and at the time , word be that he be do so under ross supervision , with the director set to return .
since then , it be generally accept that ross would take another trip to panem , particularly once the hunger game receive a overwhelmingly positive critical response and , you know , make dump truck of money .
ross have by no means be set to direct , however .
accord to the hollywood reporter , he have yet to formally sign on , and negotiation might just be proceed with some difficulty , if the process on the hunger game be any indicator .
the report cite a anonymous source familiar with ross negotiation last time , who cite it as , a terrible experience . '' .
lionsgate , unaccustomed to deal with director as establish as the four time oscar nominee and pleasantville and seabiscuit director , reportedly play some hardball with ross , who end up be pay 3 million .
that relatively low figure be no doubt help by the 5 of the film backend profit .
have deliver a critically acclaimed , zeitgeist - tap event movie , ross be doubtless expect a bigger figure for catch fire , but will lionsgate pay it ?
probably .
but maybe not .
lionsgate recently buy summit entertainment , the distributor behind the twilight franchise , mean that the lionsgate film division be now under the auspices of summit patrick wachsberger and rob friedman .
the revolving door of director on the twilight series have some fan worry that a similar policy might be carry out with the hunger game sequel .
negotiation with ross do actually begin until roughly three week before the first film release , at which point it be obvious that the film would be successful , give no small amount of leverage to the director , who co - write the screenplay with collin and billy ray .
while ross be sign on to multiple film , star jennifer lawrence , josh hutcherson , and liam hemsworth be all on board for the duration of the series .
but that not say there no potential issue there either .
the unanimously - praise lawrence be also contractually obligate to reprise she role as mystique in a sequel to last year x - man : first class .
she commitment there apparently supersede she hunger game contract , mean that if fox go ahead with another x - man at a inconvenient moment , it could complicate the catch fire schedule .
of course , all of this could be conjecture or , at the very least , over - analysis .
let not get hysterical just yet , folk .
the last five day have be a wild rollercoaster ride for '' twilight '' fan , as the film 's director be tell she service would no longer be require for the sequel , fuel speculation over she replacement , follow by a rumor about a suppose successor .
now , it seem , a battle be go on between a studio say there be no news to report and a entertainment magazine claim chris weitz be get behind the '' twilight '' steer wheel .
'' there will be a new director atop the twilight ' franchise : and he will be a man , '' entertainment weekly 's '' hollywood insider '' be report .
'' source tell ew.com that summit entertainment be about to hire chris weitz -lrb- the golden compass ' -rrb- as the shepherd for new moon , ' the second installment of stephenie meyer 's best-selling twilight ' series . '' .
although weitz be indeed offer the high-profile gig , the '' american pie '' filmmaker have spend much of the week contemplate he participation .
accord to '' twilight '' studio summit entertainment , the deal remain unconsummated .
'' no , it be not official , '' a studio representative tell mtv news on thursday evening -lrb- december 11 -rrb- .
'' we be not confirm anything at this point .
he be not sign on as the director . '' .
'' we be not confirm , '' echo a second representative .
whether ew be hear incorrectly from they source or the studio be just bide time until it can make a proper announcement , this much seem certain : catherine hardwicke be move on to future project that will not involve teenage vampire , and a man be likely to take she place .
twilighter have spend much of the week argue with each other - and attempt to form protest and letter-writing campaign - while debate whether they should speak out against the change to they beloved franchise .
whether they will warm to weitz be anyone 's guess , but at least the filmmaker can always take solace in the fact that the fanbase similarly rebel against kristen stewart and robert pattinson when they originally sign up for the film that would make they superstar .
gary ross will not direct hunger game sequel .

hunger game director gary ross will not helm the adaptation of catch fire , the second book in suzanne collin trilogy , the lo angele time report .
accord to the newspaper source , ross be in negotiation to direct the sequel , but be not able to come to a agreement over scheduling and compensation .

as a writer and a director , i simply not have the time i need to write and prep the movie i would have want to make because of the fix and tight production schedule . '' .
the director deny report that he talk with the studio , lionsgate , hit a snag .
contrary to what have be report , negotiation with lionsgate have not be problematic .
they have also be very understanding of I through this difficult decision . '' .
the second film in the hunger game trilogy be schedule to hit theater in november of 2013 , allow the studio and creator a limited window to prepare before production would need to begin .
the golden compass director chri weitz be expect to direct new moon , the sequel to the hugely successful film twilight .

rahman never give himself a chance , stand on the outside and not ever get any aggression go .
two thing be very apparent in this fight .
one , rahman have nothing left , and two , wlad be as good as he be ever be .
throw out the fact that '' the rock '' be not what he once be .
nobody have ever dominate he this way , and really neutralize he from the start of the fight .
klitschko use he great jab and distance fight to stay out of harm 's way and it be hard to think of any heavyweight outside of david haye give he any run for he money .
chris arreola have be name and hype incredibly but would probably give a effort before be stop in a round or two .
alexander povetkin might want to rethink he title shot because there do not seem to be a way for he to overcome all of the advantage that the champion have .
the weak heavyweight division do not seem to have much to offer the champion .
the two interesting fight that be out there for wlad be a showdown with wba champion , nikolay valuev or a bout with david haye .
former heavyweight champion , riddick bowe , 43-1 , 33 ko 's , return to the ring with a eight round decision win over gene pukall , 14-13-2 , 12 ko 's .
in 2005 , bowe barely escape with a decision over billy zumbrun and all the sign be there that he should never step into the ring again .
when he beat and reportedly stab he wife , bowe cite brain injury from boxing blow as the reason for he bad behavior , but now that brain damage have disappear apparently and he be back in the ring and on the road to real injury should he face somebody that can fight a tad .
the only defeat on bowe 's record be a loss to evander holyfield in 1993 , but it can be argue that he be well on he way to lose both fight with andrew golota in 1996 before the '' foul pole '' get himself disqualify with frequent and impressive low blow .
it be the only time that i have ever see a three punch combo downstairs and be probably the first for bowe .
it can even be argue that bowe lose to zumbrun .
the fact be that he should not be in the ring at all but this be boxing and i be sure that the former champion need the money and that be why he be risk he life .

the ukrainian champion drop thompson again in the sixth , and referee sam william give the challenger a standing count before stop the fight at 2 : 56 .
wladimir klitschko retain he ibf , ibo and wbo heavyweight title with a one-sided seventh-round stoppage of hasim rahman in mannheim , germany .
klitschko dominate from the outset against the former two-time champion , who chew leather from the start and barely land a blow on the ukrainian .
rahman , who take the fight at late notice after mandatory challenger alexander povetkin pull out through injury , look a shadow of the fighter that floor lennox lewis to win the title in 2001 .
the american look clueless as klitschko continually pound he face with a sharp left jab that have rahman back on he heel as early as the first session .
by the third round it be clear that rahman have nothing to offer and he could not even offload the big right hand that win he so many fight in the past .
klitschko have he on the canvas early in the sixth round with a double left hook and , as earlier in the fight , rahman merely retreat to the rope to take more snappy shot , rarely throw anything meaningful in return .
and it come to a merciful end in the seventh , referee tony week save the rock ' from further punishment just moment after warn he corner he would do just that if the challenger fail to show more intent .

klitschko vs thompson ii result : wladimir klitschko cruise again , win in six .
on jul 7 2012 , 5 : 55p .
wladimir klitschko win he 16th straight fight today , successfully defend the wba , wbo , and ibf heavyweight title against tony thompson , stop the 40 - year - old american in the sixth round of a fight that be never really close .
klitschko -lrb- 58 - 3 , 51 ko -rrb- bomb thompson with a vicious right hand in the fifth round , put he down late in the frame .
that thompson get up speak a lot about he desire to try and win , but the fight essentially end there .
he survive the round , but by the end of the sixth frame , appear mentally beaten and look for a way out .
he go down again in the corner late in the round , and this time referee sam william stop it at 2 : 56 .
klitschko have beat thompson back in 2008 , mostly dominate that fight and knock the tiger out in the 11th round .
this time , with thompson four year older and have have no significant test in the four year that have pass since they first bout , it be even as competitive as it be the first time .
thompson -lrb- 36 - 3 , 24 ko -rrb- just do have a shot in there , look old , and though he awkward southpaw style give klitschko some moment of slight discomfort , it would be a stretch to say that he trouble wladimir .
at this point with the klitschko , as much as i admire they talent , skill , dedication to they craft , and the classy manner in which they carry themselves , i just feel like have see enough from they both .
be run rerun bout now .
be there really anyone out there you can look at and see as a actual threat to they ? be there anyone on the way up who have that skill set ?
i just not see it , and have grow tired of tuning in for passionless exhibition of superiority .
i not think they kill the division , i just think they dominate it , and with no actual hope for that earth - shake upset on the horizon , i think would personally prefer to just see they both take farewell fight and head on out .
there nothing more to see here .
the major heavyweight year end much as it start , with wladimir klitschko own the division against overmatched opposition , and with hasim rahman be nothing but a shell of the man that once shockingly knock out lennox lewis .
klitschko dominate rahman over six-plus round , knock he down in a horribly one-sided sixth round and then landing enough hard blow early in the seventh for referee tony week to step in and call a end to it .
that should just about do it for the 36-year old rahman , who have not score a impressive or notable win since 2005 .
since that win over monte barrett , rahman have go 4-2-1 with a no-contest , beat nothing but club fighter , and often not even look good do that .
he be have a long , strange career , and it look like it be over at the top tier .
he be so thoroughly overmatched tonight and unwilling to fight klitschko that he be clearly get nothing leave as a top fighter .
klitschko will move on and fight alexander povetkin , chris arreola or david haye sometime in march or april , i would wager , and he should be a heavy , heavy favorite against any of they .
arreola be hurt by travis walker , povetkin just do not strike I as capable of be a truly top-notch guy , and haye be shake by monte barrett a bit even though he do basically dominate .
i would love to see klitschko-haye simply because i think haye will make wlad work .
i say during the fight that this be yet another case of klitschko fight up or down to he opponent .
haye would make he fight up .
rahman have he fight down .
the fight as also yet another example of why people crap on heavyweight fighting .
it be not interesting , be not competitive , and you clearly have one guy -lrb- rahman -rrb- not in shape to fight for more than five round .
and worse than that , he do not even fight .
in the sixth , he land one punch .
he spend a lot of time lay on the rope start in the third round , barely punch at all .
the hbo team today be lampley , kellerman and lennox , and they do they usual bit when they watch a heavyweight fight with lennox in the booth , which mean they make verbal love to lewis while lewis agree with they assessment of he as better than everyone fight today .
they be right , of course -- but we all know that .
there be even one round where lennox decide , out loud , that he be better than wladimir klitschko .
as always , a interesting group that teach I a lot about the fight i be watch .

but the bush administration in its final day bring in a rule leave it up to business to consult with government biologist on the impact of new development .
environmentalist have accuse bush of effectively gut protection for threaten or endanger species , and activist have send more than 70 , 000 petition to official in the obama administration urge they to cancel the midnight regulation .
in a statement , the commerce secretary , gary locke , and the interior secretary , ken salazar , agree .
after a scientific review order by obama last month , they say they have reach the conclusion that such protection be indeed necessary .
by roll back this 11th hour regulation we be ensure that threaten and endanger species continue to receive the full protection of the law , the two man say in a statement .
federal agency propose to take action that might affect threaten and endanger species will once again have to consult with biologist . '' .
there be no word on another so - call midnight regulation that undermine protection for polar bear , a omission criticise by some activist today .
the move , which have be anticipate , come just 24 hour after salazar take step against another midnight regulation .
the interior secretary say he would ask the court to overturn a last - minute rule that make it easier for coal mining operation engage in mountaintop removal to dump dirt near stream .

a bush administration draft plan to allow oil and gas drilling off the atlantic and pacific coast be sideline by the obama administration on feb . 10 .
to establish a orderly process that allow we to make wise decision base on sound information , we need to set aside the plan , say new interior secretary ken salazar who extend the public comment period on offshore drilling by six month .

on march 3 , obama overturn another 11th hour bush regulation that weaken the endanger species act and pit federal agency against each other .
the regulation allow federal agency to sidestep scientific evidence gather by u . s . fish and wildlife service and national marine fishery service expert when launch construction project that impact endanger wildlife .
when overturn the regulation , obama say he be restore the scientific process to its rightful place at the heart of the endanger species act , a process undermine by past administration . '' .
the obama administration will also move quickly to reverse some older bush ruling .
on january 30 , obama sign a executive order rescind a 2001 bush policy change that bar u . s . financial aid to international organization that provide or promote abortion .

for a partial list of bush '' s midnight regulation and they current status , visit propublica .
with just over a month remain in office , the bush administration loosen federal protection of plant and animal species threaten with extinction .
on thursday , the interior department announce a change to section 7 of the endanger species act , which require federal agency to consult with scientist at the fish and wildlife service or the national marine fishery service to determine whether a project be likely to affect any list species .
under the new rule , federal agency such as the federal highway administration can in many case simply check with they own personnel to determine if they activity will harm any of the 1,247 animal and 747 plant species list as endanger or threaten .
'' the rule strengthen the regulation so the government can focus on protect endanger species as it strive to rebuild the american economy , '' say secretary of the interior dirk kempthorne .
it start with the polar bear .
the rule change have its origin in a may announcement by the interior department that list the polar bear as threaten because global warming be melt its habitat .
it be the first animal to be list because of climate change .
in that announcement , interior secretary dirk kempthorne say that even though global climate change be the reason that the bear be on the endanger species list in the first place , that list be '' not the means , nor the method , nor the vehicle by which you can deal with global climate change . '' .
the interior department 's press release cite a may editorial from the washington post that endorse this view .
that mr. kempthorne have to contort he agency to ensure that it do not get drag into set we climate policy be simply more proof of the need for such a policy , support by the white house and ratify by congress , that aim at sharply reduce greenhouse-gas emission .
though the polar bear deserve protection , the endanger species act be not the means and the fish and wildlife service be not the agency to arrest global warming .
the release quote the second sentence of that paragraph .
so under the new rule , federal agency that be undertake a project need not check with fish and wildlife or national marine fishery under these circumstance .
where the action have no effect on a list species or critical habitat , or .
where the action be wholly beneficial , or .
where the effect of the action can not be measure or detect in a manner that permit meaningful evaluation use the best available science , or .
where the effect of the action be the result of global process and can not be reliably predict or measure on the scale of species current range , or would result in a insignificant impact to a list species , or be such that the potential risk of harm to a species be remote .
reaction .
environmentalist be less than thrill by this rule change .
andrew wetzler , director of the natural resource defense council 's endanger species program , say he organization will probably sue .
'' this administration have reject anything with a whiff of science .
so before sulk out the back door , they be go after rule that require fish and wildlife service scientist to prevent harm to we last wild animal and place .
despite today 's feel-good statement , we remain convinced that these change be illegal .
we will look at the final language when it be publish tomorrow , but i think we will see they in court . '' .
defender of the wildlife , who have file suit along with greenpeace and the center for biological diversity , be similarly disgust by the bush administration 's action .
'' this administration 's disdain for wildlife and the environment have never be more clear than it be today , '' say jamie rappaport clark , executive vice president of defender of wildlife and former director of the fish and wildlife service .
'' for 35 year , the endanger species act have help save and recover imperil wildlife on the brink of extinction .
now , with this administration face its last day , they be do everything they can to cement they anti-environmental legacy before the obama administration take office . '' .
the we chamber of commerce welcome the rule change .
reversible ?
obama say that he intend to reverse the rule change , along with other '' midnight rule '' make in the wane day of the bush presidency .
but that may be easier say than do .
propublica , a nonprofit investigative news organization , note that while last-minute rule that have not yet take effect can be quickly reverse by obama 's appointee or by executive order , rule that be in force when he take office can not .
rescind a rule would require the new administration to restart the rulemaking process , which can take year and prompt legal challenge .
another strategy that have be talk about lately - get congress to disapprove the rule through the congressional review act - carry political risk and have be use only once before .
the new endanger species rule take effect nine day before obama 's inauguration .
there be still a chance that the rule could be quickly reverse , however .
usa today report that rep. nick rahall -lrb- d -rrb- of west virginia , the chairman of the house natural resource committee , say that he will likely invoke the congressional review act , a rarely use law that give congress 60 day to review and overrule regulation issue by government agency .
apr 28 .
obama administration restore endanger species act protection !
today , interior secretary ken salazar and commerce secretary gary locke announce the restoration of rule under the endanger species act that help protect endanger species when government decision or project be implement .
the rule be weaken in the final day of the bush administration .
the department of interior send out this press release announce the decision today .
they decision require federal agency to once again consult with federal wildlife expert at the u . s . fish and wildlife service and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration before take any action that may affect threaten or endanger species .
the action will restore a important check - and - balance system that enable government project to move forward and at the same time protect at - risk species .
the restoration of these protection be amazing news for we country '' s wildlife , fish and plant on the brink of extinction .
make this decision within the first 100 day of office be also a important symbol that america will once again respect science and environmental protection .
the endanger species coalition be incredibly grateful to president obama , secretary locke and secretary salazar for they leadership on address the urgent environmental issue of species extinction and global warming .
for more information , check out the esc statement .
the interior department yesterday finalize rule change the way it administer the endanger species act , enable other government agency to decide on they own whether a project would harm a imperil species without a independent scientific review .
interior secretary dirk kempthorne call the move '' a clarification '' he consider essential in order to narrow the law 's reach .
'' the rule strengthen the regulation so the government can focus on protect endanger species as it strive to rebuild the american economy , '' kempthorne say , add that agency can bypass a review by either the fish and wildlife service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration only '' in specific and limited instance where a action be not anticipate to harass , harm or kill a protected species . '' .
dale hall , who direct the fish and wildlife service , say the change do not mean that agency could build dam , road or other project without take into account the consequence .
'' the agency still have the full responsibility to make that decision and to defend that decision , '' hall say , note that the loss of a imperil species , know as '' take , '' carry legal penalty .
'' they be still liable for take , if take occur . '' .
hall say he be initially concern about '' the compress time frame '' in which the agency push through the rule change , which be unveil in august , but he add that he do not '' see any harm '' in kempthorne 's final decision .
interior go ahead with the rule change one day after the environmental protection agency drop two other controversial rule change , say they have come along too late in president bush 's term white house spokesman tony fratto say the reason be that the administration have '' publicly and clearly state we intention '' to enact the endanger species measure well before a self-imposed deadline on eleventh-hour rule change .
the agency receive nearly 235,000 comment on the endanger species proposal , at least 208,000 of which be form letter decry the rule .
congressional democrat and environmentalist sharply criticize the administration for the interior department action .
'' as the bush administration fade off into the sunset , it continue to take brazen pot shot at everything in sight , include america 's landmark conservation law , the endanger species act , '' say house resource committee chairman nick j. rahall ii -lrb- d-w -rrb- , who say he would introduce legislation seek to overturn the rule next year .
separately yesterday , interior issue a finding limit the protection that could be invoke to protect polar bear , which be list as a threaten species this year , on the grounds that the bear be already protect under the marine mammal protection act .
the finding mean that the bear ' protected status could not be use to block activity such as oil and gas development outside they alaska habitat .
'' we do not believe the science be there to make the causal link between activity in the lower 48 to the take of a polar bear , '' kempthorne say .
'' to finally admit that the science compel the listing of the polar bear as threaten due to global warming , but then deny it the protection the endanger species act should provide , be nothing other than irresponsible and shameful , '' say jamie rappaport clark , executive vice president of the advocacy group defender of wildlife , add that she group would sue to overturn the rule .
update 8 : 41 p . m . est , tue march 3 , 2009 .
obama overturn bush endanger species rule .
president obama on tuesday overturn a last - minute bush administration regulation that many environmentalist claim weaken the endanger species act .
the regulation , issue a few week before george w . bush left office , make it easier for federal agency to skip consultation with government scientist before launch project that could affect endanger wildlife .
by overturn the regulation , obama say during a enthusiastic reception at the interior department , he have restore the scientific process to its rightful place at the heart of the endanger species act , a process undermine by past administration . '' .
under the bush administration rule , there be no need for a federal agency to consult with the u . s . fish and wildlife service or the national marine fishery service if that agency determine that no harm would come to a endanger species as a result of its project .
but the determination of what no harm mean rest with agency bureaucrat instead of scientist .
obama issue a memorandum that effectively suspend the regulation while order a review to determine whether it promote the purpose of the -lsb- endanger species act -rsb- . '' .
the work of scientist and expert in my administration , include right here in the interior department , will be respect , '' obama say .
for more than three decade , the endanger species act have successfully protect we nation most threaten wildlife , and we should be look for way to improve it , not weaken it . '' .
environmental group be quick to praise obama action .
president obama announcement will allow -lsb- the endanger species act -rsb- to do what it be intend : protect we nation endanger plant and animal , '' say andrew wetzler , director of the natural resource defense council endanger species program .
reverse the bush administration midnight action will restore protection for we last wild place and species . '' .
obama also help celebrate the 160th anniversary of the interior department on tuesday .
throughout we history , there be a tension between those who seek to conserve we natural resource for the benefit of future generation and those who have seek to profit from these resource , '' he tell department employee .
but be here to tell you this be a false choice .
with smart , sustainable policy , we can grow we economy today and preserve the environment for ourselves , we child and we grandchild . '' .
interior secretary dirk kempthorne announce major change thursday to the endanger species act , cause environmental group to charge that the '' midnight rule '' set to go into effect before president-elect barack obama take office be intend to eviscerate the nation 's premier wildlife-protection law .
the regulation eliminate a requirement that federal agency seek review by government scientist before approve log , mining and construction project to make sure the activity do not endanger rare animal and plant .
in addition , the regulation say the law could not be use to protect polar bear , walrus , mountain frog and other species vulnerable to the effect of global warming .
'' the bush administration be use this to go after we most imperil wildlife and kick they when they be down , '' say janette brimmer , a attorney with earthjustice , a environmental group .
'' the act be we nation 's most important law for protect wildlife like wolf , grizzly , salmon and lynx . '' .
reid cherlin , a spokesman for the obama-biden transition team , say , '' president-elect obama will review all 11th-hour regulation and will address they once he take office . '' .
obama have say he do not favor change the endanger species act .
kempthorne , at a news conference in washington , say that he know change to the act would evoke controversy but that he be certain the new rule would clear up confusion over the law that have exist for year .
'' nothing in the regulation relieve a federal agency of its responsibility to ensure that species be not harm , '' he say .
law cover 1,400 species .
the law protect 1,400 species .
in the last eight year , there have be a slowdown in add new plant and animal , build a backlog of hundred of species wait for scientific review and approval , include california 's furry pacific fisher and sierra nevada yellow-legged frog .
the interior department propose the new regulation in may and since have receive nearly 300,000 comment , the vast majority oppose the change .
hour after thursday 's announcement , three environmental group , greenpeace , defender of wildlife and center for biological diversity , file a lawsuit in u.s. district court in san francisco seek to halt regulation that they say be inconsistent with the act .
the regulation do not require federal agency to seek consultation with u.s. fish and wildlife service and national marine fishery service before approve project , the lawsuit say .
in congress , rep. edward markey , d-mass , call a hearing to review the regulation and say member would work to restore the act rep. nick rahall , d-w , say member may try to eliminate the regulation by use a special congressional act that allow the review of newly adopt administrative rule .
part of the new regulation prohibit regulator from take into account the effect of greenhouse gas on habitat and on species .
kempthorne say he legal adviser conclude that consider global warm a threat to the survival of the polar bear would require tracking emission to a particular factory and determine how that would melt arctic ice and harm the bear .
'' that be completely wrong , and they be just make that up , '' say attorney kassie siegel of the center for biological diversity , which be sue the federal government in a attempt to protect polar bear .
federal agency be suppose to look at source of greenhouse gas from project they approve , then analyze way to reduce those emission , siegel say .
'' there be no requirement to trace any molecule of ddt to the thin of bald eagle egg just as there be no requirement to trace any molecule of carbon dioxide to the death of any particular polar bear , '' she say .
in california , the requirement to consult with government biologist before construction project be particularly crucial , say mark rockwell , california state representative of the endanger species coalition , a alliance of 50 environmental , business , hunting and fish and religious group in the state .
the u.s. forest service approve log plan that might affect coastal coho salmon and steelhead , marbled murrelet and pacific fisher on national forest .
the u.s. army corps of engineer give permit for fill wetland .
without the requirement , there be no incentive for the agency to seek consultation and a biological opinion , rockwell say .
for example , the bureau of reclamation be force by the current requirement to seek biological opinion on whether the amount of water be divert from the southern part of the sacramento-san joaquin river delta would hurt the delta smell or harm chinook salmon .
protection find lack .
environmental group challenge opinion that water flow for the fish be adequate , and win decision agree that the protection be indeed lack in the plan .
'' it be the biological opinion that lead to the challenge , '' rockwell say .
'' if you do not have a opinion , you have nothing to challenge . '' .
under the new regulation , the federal agency would have the discretion of decide whether or not to ask for a consultation and opinion , rockwell say .
april 27 , 2009 . .
biologist call on obama administration to overturn bush rule that cut science out of endanger species legislation .
interior and commerce secretary must act by may 9 .
more than 1 , 300 federal and independent scientist with biological expertise and three lead scientific society today call on the interior and commerce department to overturn rule change make in january that weaken the scientific foundation of the endanger species act .
in a letter , the scientist urge the department secretary to rescind change to endanger species act regulation that allow federal agency to decide for themselves if they own project as road , dam and mine threaten imperil species .
previously , federal agency be require to consult with biologist at the u . s . fish and wildlife service or national marine fishery service before undertake or permit project .
many federal agency do not have the scientific expertise to determine the consequence of federal project on endanger species and may have vest interest in the implementation of a project , '' say stuart pimm , dori duke professor of conservation ecology at duke university , who help organize the scientist letter .
the new rule exclude expert scientist for decade have provide impartial review and critical analysis the process . '' .
the ornithological council , society for conservation biology and the wildlife society , which collectively represent more than 20 , 000 scientist , also send a letter today ask the interior and commerce secretary to rescind the change and make other improvement to the scientific base of the endanger species act .
as the threat we face continue to evolve , federal scientist must be able to evaluate they consequence for imperil species .
put boundary on the science that inform the endanger species act fundamentally undermine the ability of science and scientist to protect we nation biodiversity , '' say alan thornhill , a ecologist and executive director of the society for conservation biology .
politics play a huge role in such decision , '' say michael hutchin , executive director and ceo of the wildlife society .
expert review and oversight be critical . '' .
the rule generate concern when they be hastily push through at the end of the last administration with little discussion or debate .
the obama administration have address the rule change , but have not formally overturn it .
on march 3 , president obama direct the commerce and interior department to review it , state that we should be look at way to strengthen -lsb- the endanger species act -rsb- not weaken it . '' .
president obama also direct federal agency to continue consult with scientist on project that might harm endanger species .
congress also have take step to address the problem .
a provision in a omnibus spending bill sign by president obama on march 11 allow interior secretary ken salazar and commerce secretary gary locke to rescind the rule change within 60 day .
secretary salazar have say publicly that he be concern about the rule change , but have not indicate that he will act by the may 9 deadline .
on friday , it be report that the interior department send a rule to the white house office of management and budget that address the interagency review process but not other part of the rule that the scientist want repeal , particularly the limit on what kind of information can be use in determine how to protect the polar bear .
the content of the rule be not release .
the two letter also urge the administration to take a more comprehensive look at how science can better inform decision - make under the endanger species act .
accord to the scientist , other recent change create unrealistic deadline for scientific consultation and limit the type of information federal scientist can consider when evaluate federal project .
these change chop down the role of science in governmental decision - make , leave less than a stump behind .
the loss of science translate into real loss of biodiversity , '' say francesca grifo , a biodiversity expert and director of the union of concerned scientist scientific integrity program .
the new rule weaken the scientific foundation of the endanger species act and make it easier to base decision on politics instead of science .
in give the department the authority to roll back these rule , congress have give the american people a gift , and the department secretary need to open it . '' .
the bush administration issue two late-term regulation on thursday that environmentalist say weaken federal protection for endanger species but that interior department official defend as block a '' back-door '' attempt to regulate emission that contribute to global warming .
conservation group sue to block the new rule , reignite a fight over so-called midnight regulation that have seem to die down a day earlier when the administration decline to impose looser air pollution rule that environmentalist have fear .
previously , federal agency be require to consult with scientist who specialize in particular species before proceed with a project like a road or dam .
the project could not go forward unless the specialist certify that no harm would come to endanger plant or wildlife .
the rule announce thursday would allow federal agency to bypass those scientist in some case if the agency determine that the endanger species would not be harm .
the revision be finalize after four month of deliberation and over the objection of what official say be the bulk of nearly 235,000 public comment on the change .
the update rule also bar agency from stop a project because its emission might contribute to global warming .
opponent call the change particularly objectionable for the polar bear , which have see its habitat shrink as arctic ice cap melt .
the government declare polar bear a threaten species this year .
interior secretary dirk kempthorne call the rule change '' narrow '' and a '' common-sense '' approach to species protection .
he stress that agency could still consult with species scientist if they choose , and he reiterate he belief that climate change regulation be a '' wholly inappropriate use of the endanger species act . '' .
kempthorne acknowledge internal debate over the change , but he and other administration official say they tweak the rule in response to public comment .
environmental group pan they anyway .
janette brimmer , a attorney with earthjustice , say the administration be '' use global warming as a stalk horse to undo species protection on a broad scale . '' .
andrew wetzler , director of the natural resource defense council 's endanger species program , be blunt .
'' we will see they in court . '' .
environmentalist have tussle with the administration in its wane day over oil and gas drilling lease near national park and oil shale development across the western u.s .
they cheer wednesday , however , when the environmental protection agency say it would not revise two air pollution standard .
white house official say they have work hard to minimize the kind of end-of-term rulemaking that president bill clinton engage in heavily .
many of the late rule could be difficult for president-elect barack obama to overturn without in a lengthy process , though a little-used law could allow congress to void they .
the house select committee on energy independence and global warming hold a hearing on thursday into bush 's late energy and environmental rulemaking .
committee chairman rep. edward markey -lrb- d-mass -rrb- say the rule issue thursday show the administration be '' determine to use every last minute in office to wreak as much havoc as possible on we nation . '' .
kempthorne , for he part , sound keenly aware of time issue in a conference call with reporter , when he note he have 39 day leave in office .
ask if that give he pause for issue new rule , he reply .
'' do you think elus man should have leave the field five minute before the end of the last super bowl ? '' .

interior , commerce department overturn rule that cut science out of endanger species act .
statement by francesca grifo .
today , interior secretary ken salazar rescind eleventh - hour bush administration change to endanger species act regulation that allow federal agency to decide for themselves if they own project as road and would threaten imperil species .
federal agency again will be require to consult with expert biologist at the u . s . fish and wildlife service or national marine fishery service before undertake or permit new project .
the rule change be just one of several controversial bush administration action that undermine the scientific foundation of the endanger species act , accord to the union of concerned scientist -lrb- uc -rrb- .
in a related story , 1 , 300 biologist and three scientific society represent some 20 , 000 scientist send separate letter last friday to the interior and commerce department urge they to overturn the last - minute bush rule change .
below be a statement by francesca grifo , director of ucs scientific integrity program .
several last - minute bush administration regulatory change have undermine the scientific foundation of the endanger species act , and today the obama administration have begin to repair the damage .
the message from ten of thousand of scientist around the country be clear : these unwarranted change fundamentally undermine we ability to protect imperil plant and animal .
today , the obama administration restore critical check and balance to protect we nation biodiversity .
interior secretary salazar decision be a long - await first step .
but there be much more to be do .
the obama administration must thoroughly review how science be use to ensure that we nation imperil species have a chance to survive thrive . '' .
the we interior and commerce department report dec. 11 final propose change to the endanger species act , which interior secretary dirk a. kempthorne say be not as extensive as originally plan .
'' the rule strengthen the regulation so the government can focus on protect endanger species as it strive to rebuild the american economy , '' kempthorne say .
'' it have be revise since it be propose in august because the public make suggestion we could use to improve it , '' he say .
the propose change be schedule to appear in the dec. 12 federal register .
'' what we be do be clarify the threshold for consultation to occur .
if science can not draw a direct causal link between a action and a effect on a list species , as be currently the case for global process like climate change , than consultation under the esa be not necessary , '' kempthorne maintain .
congressional critic and environmental organization immediately criticize the proposal .
'' the bush administration appear to be determine to use every last minute in office to wreak as much havoc as possible on we nation , '' say edward j. markey -lrb- d-mass -rrb- , chairman of the house select committee on energy independence and global warming .
'' today 's announcement that they will be remove fish and wildlife expert from key decision to protect the safety of iconic animal like the polar bear from global warming 's effect be absurd and a recipe for disaster , '' markey say .
andrew wetzler , director of the natural resource defense council 's endanger species program , comment .
'' this administration have reject anything with a whiff of science , so before skulk out the back door they be go after rule that require -lsb- we -rsb- fish and wildlife service scientist to prevent harm to we last wild animal and place .
despite today 's feel-good statement , we remain convinced that these change be illegal .
we will look at the final language when it be publish tomorrow , but i think we will see they in court . '' .
scope of exception .
but kempthorne note that federal agency would be require to follow exist consultation procedure except in specific , limited instance where a propose action be not expect to have adverse impact on any member of a esa-listed species and would satisfy one of the following condition .
it must be wholly beneficial , have no effect on a list species or its critical habitat , have effect which could not be measure or detect in a manner that permit meaningful evaluation , or it must be the result of global process that can not be reliably predict or measure on the scale of the species ' current range .
agency still would be able to voluntarily engage in the consultation process , the secretary emphasize .
he say the final propose regulation contain fewer opportunity for agency to proceed without consultation than what be originally envision .
nothing in the proposal require that a federal agency bypass consultation , nor do it preclude any federal agency from seek the expertise of the fish and wildlife service and the national marine fishery service or from take advantage of expertise that may be available from state and local agency , university , nongovernment organization , or other source , accord to kempthorne .
any federal agency may avail itself of expertise offer by fw and nmf in exactly the same manner as under current regulation if it determine it have any limitation to make determination under the esa or believe that it do not have the scientific expertise to make a accurate assessment of a project 's impact on list species and critical habitat , he say .
moreover , nothing in the proposal relieve a agency of its responsibility to ensure that list species be not harm during completion of a federal action , regardless of whether consultation occur or not , kempthorne say .
in case where a action agency determine that consultation be not require and harm to a list species result , full civil and criminal penalty , as lay out by other section of the esa , remain in effect , he indicate .
obama reverse bush on species protection measure .
march 04 , 2009 .
in a move that will subject a number of government project to enhance environmental and scientific scrutiny , president obama be restore a requirement that u . s . agency consult with independent federal expert to determine whether they action might harm threaten and endanger species .
the presidential memorandum issue yesterday , which mark yet another reversal of former president george w . bush environmental legacy , will revive a decade - old practice under the endanger species act that call for agency to consult with either the fish and wildlife service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration on whether they project could affect imperil species .
on dec . 16 , the bush administration allow agency to waive such review if they decide , on they own , that the action would not harm vulnerable plant and animal .
obama , who visit the interior department to commemorate its 160th anniversary , say he have instruct interior and commerce department official to review the bush rule .
in the meantime , accord to the memorandum , official should follow the prior longstanding consultation and concurrence practice that call for independent review .
the work of scientist and expert in my administration , include here at the interior department , will be respect , '' obama say .
with smart , sustainable policy , we can grow we economy today and preserve the environment . '' .
environmentalist and scientist welcome the move , but business official say it could delay federally funded project that could help revive the nation economy : all of they agree it would prompt a second look at several initiative adopt by the bush administration in its final month in office .
earthjustice lawyer janette brimmer , whose group have challenge the bush rule in federal district court in california , say she expect that the new administration would reexamine two pend project : a bureau of land management plan for oversee oregon forest , which be finalize on dec . 30 and could affect protected species such as the northern spotted owl ; and construction of the white pine coal - fire power plant in nevada .
i think the obama administration now be go to take a step back on these project .
it need to bring science back into the equation , '' brimmer say , add that she group will not drop its lawsuit until it can assess how the new policy be work .
francesca grifo of the union of concerned scientist , a activist group , say the switch would help guard against the potential conflict of interest and lack of expertise that could color decision - make by any agency hope to press ahead with a particular project .
after year of scientific scandal , the interior department and its partner agency need desperately to regain credibility by make decision with honesty , clarity and transparency , '' grifo say .
but william l . kovac , the u . s . chamber of commerce vice president of environment , technology and regulatory affair , say that revive another layer of review will result in even greater delay to project - - include stimulus - back , job - create project - - as agency now grapple with the prospect of lengthy interagency consultation to determine , for instance , if a bridge project in florida contribute to the melting of arctic ice .
this be such a departure from the spirit and the letter of the endanger species act that we wonder if the law drafter would even recognize it today . '' .
the latest policy shift follow several other administration action revamp environmental policy , include a reexamination of fuel economy standard and offshore oil drilling ; a new review of whether to grant california and other state the right to regulate greenhouse - gas emission from vehicle ; and the endorsement of a new international treaty negotiation on global mercury emission .
house natural resource committee chairman nick j . rahall ii -lrb- d - w . va . -rrb- , who have be seek to overturn bush endanger species rule through legislation , call the announcement one more indication that the new administration truly represent change for the better and be commit to the protection of we natural resource and we environment . '' .
official say the move be unlikely to trigger broad use of the endanger species act to regulate greenhouse - gas emission .
while the bush rule specifically prohibit endanger species consultation on the basis of global process such as climate change , a interior official speaking on the condition of anonymity say that under the new policy , such a review would be trigger only if scientific evidence suggest a causal connection between emission from a federal project and its effect on a imperil species or a identifiable part of its habitat .
when plan to widen interstate 90 through snoqualmie pass , state transportation brass , federal agency and green wisely opt to cut down on road -lrb- and people -rrb- kill , and to give peace a chance .
the result will be a series of wildlife overpass and underpass , and effort to make gold creek a healthy home to the endanger bull trout .
the unspoken trade-off : no lawsuit will hold up or raise cost on work that benefit the economy , and ease the drive to and from eastern washington .
before leave the political stage , the bush administration aim to kiss off this kind of modest use of intelligence .
it be , say rep. jay inslee , d-wash , the bushy ' '' last sour note . '' .
use the christmas season for cover , the interior department on thursday issue '' revise '' regulation design to shield federal project from review under the endanger species act .
'' i have be wait and hold my breath for one last awful thing -lrb- bush -rrb- would do to be remember by , and he have do it , '' say rep. jim mcdermott , d-wash .
the administration ignore comment from 300,000 citizen and adopt a policy that would allow federal agency to ignore one of the nation 's basic environmental law .
it would eliminate some requirement for independent review by scientist -- notably from the u.s. fish and wildlife service and national marine fishery service -- as agency plan project involve timber sale , road construction and oil lease .
new rule would also prohibit federal agency from assess how a propose project would add to global warming or jeopardize species habitat .
'' nothing in this regulation relieve a federal agency of its responsibility to ensure that species be not harm , '' interior secretary dirk kempthorne tell reporter .
huh ?
'' if this rule have be implement in year past , highway builder could have do what they want , without talk to the fish and wildlife service .
we would probably not be see the improvement on i-90 , '' say rick mcguire of the alpine lakes protection society .
'' the i-90 corridor have be a berlin wall between the northern cascade and southern cascade .
if you do not make the means to cross a road like this , it be bad for wildlife .
and it be bad for people who hit wildlife . '' .
inslee note the administration 's recent two-step maneuver in the chukchi sea off the north coast of alaska .
the fish and wildlife service formally list the polar bear under the endanger species act , due to the threat from global warming .
ignore the listing , the fed ' mineral management service proceed to sell oil lease where the bear live .
the bush administration finalize a retroactive justification on thursday .
it create a '' special rule '' for polar bear , allow oil and gas drilling , as long as oil company obey the marine mammal protection act .
'' polar bear do not need a listing .
they need ice , '' say inslee .
inslee note the role of the late sen. henry jackson , d-wash , who back oil development in the arctic and help write the endanger species act .
'' senator jackson and other have the foresight and intelligence to say : let we allow the expertise of government scientist to be tap before decision be make , '' inslee add .
'' that be what the consultation process do .
it have be use to good effect in we state . '' .
critic of the endanger species act often substitute anecdote for fact .
they have argue that consultation with government scientist mean holdup and more work .
in a filing with the interior department , however , the natural resource defense council note that no evidence of delay and cost be produce to support relax the law .
quite the contrary .
the new policy nix informal consultation between agency intend to determine whether a project need more formal and detailed environmental review .
the likely result will be '' erroneous finding '' by agency , argue the nrdc .
what be the consequence ?
project opponent will get grounds to sue .
'' we will look at the final -lrb- rule -rrb- language when it be publish tomorrow , but i think we will see they in court , '' say andrew welzler of the nrdc .
put tooth back in the endanger species act , and reverse the new rule , present a tricky , time-consuming task for the obama administration .
the makeup of obama 's environmental team have surface in recent day .
it be urban , and largely eastern .
the incoming environmental protection agency boss , lisa jackson , have work as new jersey 's environmental commissioner .
soon-to-be senior white house aide carol browner , a al gore protagonist , be from florida .
obama brass would be well advise to turn for help to the pacific northwest and mountain west .
we government leader have deal with tricky issue involve endanger species act listing of puget sound salmon run and orca .
east coast environmentalist , in high government post , prove tone-deaf and clumsy when deal with endanger species issue in the clinton and carter administration .
what be need now be political savvy , plus what george w. bush , in he 2000 campaign , describe as '' sound science . '' .

obama administration flip bush endanger species ruling .
04 / 28 / 09 07 : 35 pm et .
federal agency again will have to consult with government wildlife expert before take action that could have a impact on threaten or endanger species .
the obama administration say tuesday it be overturn a rule change make in the final week of the bush presidency .
official at the interior and commerce department say they have reimpose the consultation requirement that assure the government top biologist involve in species protection will have a say in federal action that could harm plant , animal and fish that be at risk of extinction .
such consultation have be require for more than two decade until the bush administration make it optional in rule issue last december , just week before the change in administration .
environmentalist argue that the change severely reduce the protection afford under the federal endangered species act .
by roll back this eleventh - hour regulation , we be ensure that threaten and endanger species continue to receive the full protection of the law and that top science will be the foundation of the decision making , say interior secretary ken salazar .
commerce secretary gary locke add : we decision affirm the administration commitment to use sound science to promote conservation and protect the environment . '' .
agency in the two department share responsibility for managing and enforce the endanger species act and employ the government top scientist in species protection .
in march , president barack obama issue a executive order put the bush rule change on hold .
congress follow by give specific authorization for the interior and commerce department to revoke the action , avoid a long and complicated regulatory process .
environmentalist widely praise tuesday action , but some express dismay that salazar do also rescind a rule that limit the protection to the polar bear , which last year be declare as threaten under the endanger species act because of disappear arctic sea ice as a result of climate change .
the bush administration issue a rule that prohibit a agency from take into account indirect adverse impact on the polar bear from activity outside of the arctic region : for example carbon dioxide emission that be link to global warming and , therefore , the loss of arctic sea ice .
congress authorize that rule to be revoke as well , but the interior department say no decision have yet be make on the matter .
from we perspective the job be half do , '' say noah greenwald of the center for biological diversity , a advocacy group .
the polar bear arctic sea ice habitat be melt away .
if the -lrb- bush -rrb- special rule be not strike down the polar bear be likely to be the first large mammal to go extinct due to global warming in the united state . '' .
the end of the long - standing requirement _ date back to 1986 _ of interagency consultation with the interior and commerce agency on endanger species protection produce a firestorm in both congress and within the environmental and conservation community .
for year , agency involve in thousand of federal activity _ from issue clean air rule to approve highway or dam construction _ have have to consult not only they own expert but also biologist at the u . s . fish and wildlife service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to ensure the activity do not harm plant , animal or fish that be protect by the endanger species act .
developer and business group argue that the consultation cause unneeded delay and increase the cost of project .
the bush administration make the independent consultation optional , argue that it be a minor shift in policy .
one impetus for the rule change be concern by the bush administration that the endanger species act might be use as a back door to regulate greenhouse gas as a way to combat climate change .
the interior department earlier have declare the polar bear a threaten species because of the loss of arctic sea ice , a change attribute to global warming .
salazar and lock say the two department will jointly decide if any change be need to improve the interagency consultation procedure .
the fish and wildlife service , which be part of the interior department , have jurisdiction over plant and animal , while noaa , part of the commerce department , deal with fish species that be at risk of extinction .
just six week before president-elect barack obama take office , the bush administration issue revise endanger species regulation thursday to reduce the input of federal scientist and to block the law from be use to fight global warming .
the change , which will go into effect in about 30 day , be complete in just four month .
but they could take obama much longer to reverse .
they will eliminate some of the mandatory , independent review that government scientist have perform for 35 year on dam , power plant , timber sale and other project , a step that developer and other federal agency have blame for delay and cost increase .
the rule also prohibit federal agency from evaluate the effect on endanger species and the place they live from a project 's contribution to increase global warming .
interior department official describe the change as '' narrow , '' but admit that the regulation be controversial inside the agency .
environmentalist view they as erode the protection for endanger species .
interior official say federal agency could still seek the expertise of federal wildlife biologist on a voluntary basis , and that other part of the law will ensure that species be protect .
'' nothing in this regulation relieve a federal agency of its responsibility to ensure that species be not harm , '' say interior secretary dirk kempthorne in a conference call with reporter .
current rule require biologist in the fish and wildlife service and national marine fishery service to sign off on project even when it be determine that they be not likely to harm species .
the rule finalize thursday would do away with that requirement , reduce the number of consultation so that the government 's expert can focus on case that pose the greatest harm to wildlife , official say .
but environmentalist say that the rule change would put decision about endanger species into the hand of agency with a vested interest in advance a project and with little expertise about wildlife .
several environmental group file a lawsuit in federal court in san francisco hour after the rule 's announcement .
jamie rappaport clark , a former director of the fish and wildlife service and a vice president of defender of wildlife , say thursday that the change target the '' absolute heart of the endanger species act . '' .
clark tell a house hearing on the bush administration 's last-minute environmental regulation that these change remove '' a system of check and balance that provide a essential safety net for imperil animal and plant . '' .
between 1998 and 2002 , the fish and wildlife service conduct 300,000 consultation .
the national marine fishery service , which evaluate project affect marine species , conduct about 1,300 review each year .
the review have help safeguard protected species such as bald eagle , florida panther and whoop crane .
a federal government handbook from 1998 describe the consultation as '' some of the most valuable and powerful tool to conserve list species . '' .
the bush administration work diligently to get the change in place before obama take over , corral 15 expert in washington in october to sort through 250,000 write comment from the public on the revision in 32 hour .
obama have say he would work to reverse the change .
but because the rule take effect before he be swear in , he would have to restart the lengthy rulemaking process .
house natural resource committee chairman rep. nick rahall , d-w , say he would seek to overturn the regulation use the congressional review act after consult with other democratic leader .
the rarely use law allow congress to review new federal regulation .
congress have oppose similar change to the endanger species protection in the past .
in 2003 , the bush administration impose similar rule that would have allow agency to approve new pesticide and wildfire reduction project without seek the opinion of government scientist .
the pesticide rule be later overturn in court .
the interior department , along with the forest service , be currently be sue over the rule govern wildfire prevention .
in 2005 , the house pass a bill that would have make similar change to the endanger species act , but the bill die in the senate .
oklahoma sen. jame inhofe , the lead republican on the senate environment and public work committee , say in a statement the new regulation be '' common-sense change to a law much overdue for reform . '' .
there be a handful of other environmental regulation still pend before bush leaf office , include a rule to exempt large agricultural operation from report release of ammonia and other hazardous air pollutant .
they must be finalize by dec. 19 in order for they go into effect before jan. 20 .
in a related development , the interior department also finalize thursday a special rule for the polar bear , a species that be list as threaten in may because of global warming .
the rule would allow oil and gas exploration in area where the bear live , as long as the company comply with the marine mammal protection act .
obama administration overturn rule that weaken endanger species act .
april 28 , 2009 .
interior secretary ken salazar announce today that the obama administration will reverse a endanger species act -lrb- esa -rrb- regulation that allow federal agency to go ahead with action that may impact endanger species without consult with expert , essentially circumvent the role of conservation scientist in such decision .
by roll back this eleventh - hour regulation , we be ensure that threaten and endanger species continue to receive the full protection of the law say salazar .
the change to the esa be make last december by the bush administration and draw heavy criticism from environmental and conservation group .
at the time , during heavy campaigning , obama state that he oppose the last minute rule change with a spokesman state : '' as president , senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protection of the endanger species act and undo this proposal from president bush . '' .
darin schroeder , vice president for conservation advocacy at the environmental organization , american bird conservancy , agree with salazar '' s decision .
'' we be gratified secretary salazar and secretary locke act to restore the endanger species act to its intended strength .
the consultation process be one of the cornerstone of the esa , and one of the key check and balance that ensure protection for the 90 bird and 1 , 263 other animal and plant it cover . '' .
another anticipate ruling regard polar bear have not be announce yet .
while the bush administration find that melt ice in the arctic due to climate change be endanger polar bear , they rule that the esa could not use to regulate carbon emission in order to protect the polar bear .
salazar must make a judgment on this rule by may 9th .
'' secretary salazar take a important step today toward restore need protection for endanger species , '' say noah greenwald , biodiversity program director for the center for biological diversity .
'' but he still need to rescind the special rule for the polar bear , which amount to a death sentence for the majestic bear because it exempt greenhouse gas emission from regulation . '' .
the bush administration on thursday eliminate 35-year-old regulation in the endanger species act that require a independent scientific review of propose federal project to determine whether they imperil protected plant and animal .
instead , federal agency undertake project like road and power plant construction or oil and gas drilling will make they own assessment .
without the independent review , such project could be accelerate .
as part of the change announce by interior secretary dirk kempthorne in the final day of the bush administration , the department finalize a interim rule that allow oil and gas drilling in polar bear habitat off alaska 's coast .
the rule change be design to prevent the endanger species act from be use to regulate greenhouse gas emission , essentially make climate change policy .
kempthorne , who characterize the new rule as a common-sense streamlining of bureaucratic process , acknowledge that there be disagreement within the department regard the rule , which take effect in 30 day .
under current law , agency must submit any plan that could harm species on the endanger list for review by scientist at the u.s. fish and wildlife service , which enforce the endanger species act .
the process have be criticize by home builder group and the oil and gas industry for delay costly project .
the consultation requirement be intend as more than just a check and balance .
jamie rappaport clark , executive vice president of defender of wildlife and director of fish and wildlife under president clinton , say the consultation process resolve the problem of '' mission conflict '' between agency .
the department of defense , for example , might not understand why a endanger plant should be consider when expand a bombing range .
'' the problem be the agency do not always properly consider , understand or protect species in they habitat because they be focus on the pursuit of they primary mission , '' clark say .
'' it be hard for the biologist to satisfy they responsibility to protect species if the agency perceive it affect they primary mission . '' .
president-elect barack obama say he would reverse the rule change , as have some member of congress .
but that require a lengthy rule-making process .
in the house , member can invoke the rarely use congressional review act to overturn the regulation .
'' these change be go to result in more species be put in jeopardy , '' clark say .
'' but more importantly , we be not go to know what we do not know anymore . '' .
official say agency would still be hold liable if they approve project that harm threaten or endanger species .
kempthorne also note that any federal agency could choose to informally consult with the fish and wildlife service at any time .
h. dale hall , director of fish and wildlife , say he have concern about how fast the estimate 235,000 public comment be process .
staff assign to the job spend eight hour a day tabulate the comment .
work under strict time restraint , agency employee have nine seconds to read each letter , accord to one calculation .
official say that more than 200,000 of the comment oppose the rule change .
attempt to revise the endanger species act have be rebuff by congress in recent year .
sen. barbara boxer -lrb- d-calif -rrb- say thursday 's action be another assault on the law .
'' these midnight regulation be part of a continue effort by the bush administration to repeal we landmark environmental law through the back door and weaken protection for we nation 's endanger species , '' she say in a statement .
'' i believe they be illegal , and if similar regulation have be in place , they would have undermine we ability to protect the bald eagle , the grizzly bear and the gray whale , '' boxer say .
environmental group , which take the administration to court to force it to list the polar bear , vow to continue the legal battle .
three group , the center for biological diversity , greenpeace and defender of wildlife , file suit in san francisco hour after the change be announce , argue that the regulation fail to follow the public review process .
'' the bush administration have repackage the same old lump of coal as a holiday present for the polar bear , and once again hand its friend in the oil industry a huge gift , '' say kassie siegel , climate program director at the center for biological diversity and lead author of the 2005 petition to list polar bear .
'' these regulation seem design to drive the polar bear extinct . '' .
the rule regard polar bear come seven month after that animal become the first to be place on the endanger species list primarily because of global climate change .
the melting of sea ice be threaten the polar bear with extinction .
this summer , score of polar bear be observe swimming in open sea , far from land or ice floe .
but kempthorne say that he would not allow the 1973 law to be use as a '' back door for implement climate-change policy . '' .
to that end , he clarify regulation address threat to polar bear habitat : greenhouse emission from automobile , power plant and other human activity .
the act require federal agency to designate habitat critical to the creature 's survival , then protect it by strict enforcement .
kempthorne say that accord to he reading , court ruling require pinpoint a specific source of a threat to habitat -- something that he say be scientifically impossible .
that interpretation of the court ' opinion give the government few option to protect polar bear habitat .
president obama overturn endanger species rule bush instate .
former president bush have enact legislation that could have put more animal in danger .
mar 4 , 2009 .
in a move that could anger some people on the other side of the aisle , president obama overturn a administration regulation that could have possibly weaken the stability of the endanger species act .
before former president george w . bush left office , he pass legislation that would have allow federal agency to skip consultation before launch project that could affect endanger wildlife .
this could have put more animal at risk , and while it would have eliminate a lot of red tape in the process , it could have be more risky to endanger animal than necessary .
the problem with the legislation by bush be that it be take scientist out of the equation , and basically remove the most knowledgeable people from the equation .
it would have give a lot of additional power to federal agency , but strip a lot of the rights that the endanger species act give to the animal which it seek to protect .
while the act be not perfect in its implementation or enforcement , undermine by remove any tooth that it might have be a big step in the wrong direction .
president obama have already receive immense support from environmentalist for this move , and by overturn something the bush administration put in place , he show that he be also willing to step up to the plate on issue such as these .
by flat out declare that it be necessary to ensure that no harm will come to endanger species as the result of new project , it give the endanger species act more strength , and do a lot to further the cause of environmentalist look to protect these animal .
with scientist be put back into the equation , it give a lot of hope that the threaten wildlife will stand a better chance at survive over the long term .
it be a questionable move when bush make the move to approve the last - minute legislation during he second term , and while there be a lot of objection , nothing could really be do at the time .
with a eye toward the future , president obama make a really smart decision by bring scientist back into the endanger species fold , and surely help to save a number of animal that could have otherwise be put at risk .
in a move environmental group say strike at the heart of the endanger species act , the bush administration on thursday announce a new rule that would let federal agency decide on they own whether they project harm endanger species , instead of require they in many case to get a second opinion from federal wildlife expert .
biologist call on obama administration to overturn bush rule that cut science out of endanger species decision .
interior and commerce secretary must act by may 9 .
washington - april 27 - .
more than 1 , 300 federal and independent scientist with biological expertise and three lead scientific society today call on the interior and commerce department to overturn rule change make in january that weaken the scientific foundation of the endanger species act .
in a letter , the scientist urge the department secretary to rescind change to endanger species act regulation that allow federal agency to decide for themselves if they own project - - such as road , dam and mine - - would threaten imperil species .
previously , federal agency be require to consult with biologist at the u . s . fish and wildlife service or national marine fishery service before undertake or permit project .
many federal agency do not have the scientific expertise to determine the consequence of federal project on endanger species and may have vest interest in the implementation of a project , '' say stuart pimm , dori duke professor of conservation ecology at duke university , who help organize the scientist letter .
the new rule exclude expert scientist - - who for decade have provide impartial review and critical analysis - - from the process . '' .
the ornithological council , society for conservation biology and the wildlife society , which collectively represent more than 20 , 000 scientist , also send a letter today ask the interior and commerce secretary to rescind the change and make other improvement to the scientific base of the endanger species act .
as the threat we face continue to evolve , federal scientist must be able to evaluate they consequence for imperil species .
put boundary on the science that inform the endanger species act fundamentally undermine the ability of science and scientist to protect we nation biodiversity , '' say alan thornhill , a ecologist and executive director of the society for conservation biology .
politics play a huge role in such decision , '' say michael hutchin , executive director and ceo of the wildlife society .
expert review and oversight be critical . '' .
the rule generate concern when they be hastily push through at the end of the last administration with little discussion or debate .
the obama administration have address the rule change , but have not formally overturn it .
on march 3 , president obama direct the commerce and interior department to review it , state that we should be look at way to strengthen -lsb- the endanger species act -rsb- - - not weaken it . '' .
president obama also direct federal agency to continue consult with scientist on project that might harm endanger species .
congress also have take step to address the problem .
a provision in a omnibus spending bill sign by president obama on march 11 allow interior secretary ken salazar and commerce secretary gary locke to rescind the rule change within 60 day .
secretary salazar have say publicly that he be concern about the rule change , but have not indicate that he will act by the may 9 deadline .
on friday , it be report that the interior department send a rule to the white house office of management and budget that address the interagency review process but not other part of the rule that the scientist want repeal , particularly the limit on what kind of information can be use in determine how to protect the polar bear .
the content of the rule be not release .
the two letter also urge the administration to take a more comprehensive look at how science can better inform decision - make under the endanger species act .
accord to the scientist , other recent change create unrealistic deadline for scientific consultation and limit the type of information federal scientist can consider when evaluate federal project .
these change chop down the role of science in governmental decision - make , leave less than a stump behind .
the loss of science translate into real loss of biodiversity , '' say francesca grifo , a biodiversity expert and director of the union of concerned scientist scientific integrity program .
the new rule weaken the scientific foundation of the endanger species act and make it easier to base decision on politics instead of science .
in give the department the authority to roll back these rule , congress have give the american people a gift , and the department secretary need to open it . '' .
