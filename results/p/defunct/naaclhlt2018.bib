  abstract = 	 {Cross-entropy loss together with softmax is arguably one of the most common used supervision components in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Despite its simplicity, popularity and excellent performance, the component does not explicitly encourage discriminative learning of features. In this paper, we propose a generalized large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss which explicitly encourages intra-class compactness and inter-class separability between learned features. Moreover, L-Softmax not only can adjust the desired margin but also can avoid overfitting. We also show that the L-Softmax loss can be optimized by typical stochastic gradient descent. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the deeply-learned features with L-softmax loss become more discriminative, hence significantly boosting the performance on a variety of visual classification and verification tasks.}

@misc{clark2016improving,
  abstract = {A long-standing challenge in coreference resolution has been the
incorporation of entity-level information - features defined over clusters of
mentions instead of mention pairs. We present a neural network based
coreference system that produces high-dimensional vector representations for
pairs of coreference clusters. Using these representations, our system learns
when combining clusters is desirable. We train the system with a
learning-to-search algorithm that teaches it which local decisions (cluster
merges) will lead to a high-scoring final coreference partition. The system
substantially outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the English and
Chinese portions of the CoNLL 2012 Shared Task dataset despite using few
hand-engineered features.},
