% motivation / others' weaknesses
Coreference resolution systems for entities and/or events almost invariably make use of many linguistic, parsing-based features which concern both the mention words (i.e., the entities and/or events) and their contexts.
% our novelty and contributions
In contrast, we (1) introduce a new state-of-the-art event coreference resolution system which uses only lemmatization and its corresponding precomputed word-/char- embeddings; and (2) exhaustively illustrate the performance of other commonly-used features.  The crux of our system is that it first makes pairwise event-coreference predictions by using a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (henceforth referred to as Conjoined Convolutional Neural Network or CCNN).  Next, we cluster the event mentions with a simple, but novel, neural approach which performs merges in an easy-first, cluster-holistic manner, allowing our system to be less susceptible to errors that are made from exclusively min-pairwise decision.
% These features typically include part-of-speech, dependency parse information, lemmatization, WordNet hypernyms/synonyms, FrameNet semantic roles, etc.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
%An entity is typically defined as being a person, location, organization, or time, whereas an event is an action or occurrence.  And, a mention is a specific instance of an entity or event (e.g., \textit{she} or \textit{announced}).

% problem definition/statement
Coreference resolution is the task of trying to identify -- within a single text or across multiple documents -- which \textit{mentions} refer to the same underlying discourse \textit{entity} or \textit{event}.  Naturally, one may be solely interesting in determining if two given entities co-refer to the same object (e.g., a pairwise prediction of \textit{she} and \textit{Mary} co-referring); however, ultimately, coreference resolution is a clustering task, whereby we wish to group all like-mentions together.  Successfully doing so can be useful for several other core NLP tasks that concern natural language understanding, such as information extraction \cite{Humphreys:1997}, topic detection \cite{Allan:1998}, text summarization \cite{Daniel:2003}, knowledge base population \cite{Cross_Document_Coreference_Resolution_A_Key_Technology_for_Learning_by_Reading}, question answering \cite{Narayanan:2004:QAB:1220355.1220455}, etc.
% motivation
Coreference Resolution has always been one of the fundamental tasks within NLP, and with the ever-increasing amount of textual, digital data that is generated and consumed in present-day, it remains both important and challenging.

% others' work
Specifically, coreference systems aim to find a globally-optimal fit of mentions to clusters, whereby every mention $m$ in the corpus is assigned to exactly one cluster $C$, the membership of which constitutes that every ${m_i,m_j} \in C_k$ is co-referent with each other.  If a given $m_i$ is not anaphoric with any other $m_j$, then it should belong to its own $C_k$ with a membership of one.  Further, the number of distinct clusters is not known apriori but is bounded by the number of mentions and is part of the system's inference.  Finding such a globally-optimal assignment is NP-Hard and thus computationally intractable.  In attempt to avoid this, systems typically perform pairwise-mention predictions, then use those predictions to build up clusters. The specific modelling strategies for such approximately fall into two categories: (1) mention-ranking / mention-pairs; and (2) entity-centric.

\textbf{Mention-ranking} models define a scoring a function $f(m_i,m_j)$ which operates on any $m_j$ and possible antecedent $m_i$, where $m_i$ occurs earlier in the document and could be null (represented by $\epsilon$ and denoting that $m_j$ is non-anaphoric).  Although these models are by definition less expressive than entity-based models, their inference can be relatively simple and effective, allowing them to be fast and scalable.  As a consequence, they have often been the approach used by many state-of-the-art systems \cite{Soon:2001:MLA:972597.972602,DBLP:conf/emnlp/DurrettK13,DBLP:journals/corr/WisemanRS16}.

\textbf{Mention-pair} models are defined almost identically, with the subtle difference being the target objective of the pairwise-candidates.  That is, mention-ranking model aim to find the ideal $m_i$ antecedent for every $m_j$, whereas mention-pair models score all possible $(m_i,m_j)$ pairs \cite{Bengtson:2008:UVF:1613715.1613756}.

\textbf{Entity-centric} models differ in that they focus on building a global representation of each underlying entity, the basis of which determines each mention's membership -- as opposed to the most local pairwise- elements that comprise the aforementioned models \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/WisemanRS16,conf/acl/ClarkM16}.

In this work, we use a novel and powerfully simple mention-ranking model that is designed solely to discriminate between input pairs of features: Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks, which, for political reasons, we will henceforth refer to as our newly-coined term, Conjoined Convolutional Neural Networks (or CCNN).  Further, we aim to replace the main weakness of mention-ranking models with an approach resembling the main strength of entity-centric models.  Specifically, we aim to combine all linked mention pairs into a cluster via a simple neural, easy-first, clustering approach which factors in a small, but effective, notion of the entire cluster at large.
%instead of combining all linked pairs of mentions into a cluster, independent of how they relate to the other mentions in the cluster
%in lieu of sim
%maintaining a true entity-level representation against which all candidate mentions will be compared and added, we  


Additionally, regardless of the modelling approach, most research typically uses a plethora of relatively-expensive parsing-based features, including dependency parse information, lemmatization, WordNet hypernyms/synonyms, FrameNet semantic roles, part-of-speech, etc.  Although some research includes a listing of the learned feature weights of a system (corresponding to each feature's importance) \cite{journals/tacl/YangCF15}, there has been a striking lack of work which takes the minimalistic approach and illustrates the effects of using few features.  We aim to address this by starting with the widely-accepted strong baseline of \textit{SameLemma} -- two objects are co-referent if, and only if, they have the same lemmatization -- and then evaluate the effectiveness of slowly adding other commonly used features.

Finally, in general, entity coreference resolution has received drastically more attention than event coreference.  This lack of research could in part be due to events' often involving more complex nature: a single underlying event may be described via multiple lexicographically-differing mentions, yet different underlying events may also be represented by mentions that lexicographically look the same.  This latter case is less common in entity coreference; other than pronouns, usually mentions' having the same text is a strong indication that the mentions are co-referent.  In this paper, we are exclusively interested in event coreference.

In summary, we introduce a novel approach to event coreference resolution by performing mention-ranking with a Conjoined Convolutional Neural Network and unusually few features.  We contribute a detailed performance analysis of other commonly used features.  And last, we combine our predicted mention pairs into a cluster via a simple, neural approach which attempts to represent each cluster as a whole, yielding us with state-of-the-art results on the ECB+ corpus.

\section{General Instructions}

Manuscripts must be in two-column format.  Exceptions to the
two-column format include the title, authors' names and complete
addresses, which must be centered at the top of the first page, and
any full-width figures or tables (see the guidelines in
Subsection~\ref{ssec:first}). {\bf Type single-spaced.}  Start all
pages directly under the top margin. See the guidelines later
regarding formatting the first page.  The manuscript should be
printed single-sided and its length
should not exceed the maximum page limit described in Section~\ref{sec:length}.
Pages are numbered for  initial submission. However, {\bf do not number the pages in the camera-ready version}.

By uncommenting {\small\verb|\aclfinalcopy|} at the top of this 
 document, it will compile to produce an example of the camera-ready formatting; by leaving it commented out, the document will be anonymized for initial submission.  When you first create your submission on softconf, please fill in your submitted paper ID where {\small\verb|***|} appears in the {\small\verb|\def\aclpaperid{***}|} definition at the top.

The review process is double-blind, so do not include any author information (names, addresses) when submitting a paper for review.  
However, you should maintain space for names and addresses so that they will fit in the final (accepted) version.  The NAACL-HLT 2018 \LaTeX\ style will create a titlebox space of 2.5in for you when {\small\verb|\aclfinalcopy|} is commented out.  

The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to NAACL-HLT 2018 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No authors may be added to or removed from submissions to NAACL-HLT 2018 after the submission deadline.

\subsection{The Ruler}
The NAACL-HLT 2018 style defines a printed ruler which should be presented in the
version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
circumlocution.  If you are preparing a document without the provided
style files, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to
appear on the final output pages.  The presence or absence of the ruler
should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The
camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (\LaTeX\ users may uncomment the {\small\verb|\aclfinalcopy|} command in the document preamble.)  

Reviewers: note that the ruler measurements do not align well with
lines in the paper -- this turns out to be very difficult to do well
when the paper contains many figures and equations, and, when done,
looks ugly. In most cases one would expect that the approximate
location will be adequate, although you can also use fractional
references ({\em e.g.}, the first paragraph on this page ends at mark $108.5$).

\subsection{Electronically-available resources}

NAACL-HLT provides this description in \LaTeX2e{} ({\small\tt naaclhlt2018.tex}) and PDF
format ({\small\tt naaclhlt2018.pdf}), along with the \LaTeX2e{} style file used to
format it ({\small\tt naaclhlt2018.sty}) and an ACL bibliography style ({\small\tt acl\_natbib.bst})
and example bibliography ({\small\tt naaclhlt2018.bib}).
These files are all available at
{\small\tt http://naacl2018.org/downloads/ naaclhlt2018-latex.zip}. 
 We
strongly recommend the use of these style files, which have been
appropriately tailored for the NAACL-HLT 2018 proceedings.

\subsection{Format of Electronic Manuscript}
\label{sect:pdf}

For the production of the electronic manuscript you must use Adobe's
Portable Document Format (PDF). PDF files are usually produced from
\LaTeX\ using the \textit{pdflatex} command. If your version of
\LaTeX\ produces Postscript files, you can convert these into PDF
using \textit{ps2pdf} or \textit{dvipdf}. On Windows, you can also use
Adobe Distiller to generate PDF.

Please make sure that your PDF file includes all the necessary fonts
(especially tree diagrams, symbols, and fonts with Asian
characters). When you print or create the PDF file, there is usually
an option in your printer setup to include none, all or just
non-standard fonts.  Please make sure that you select the option of
including ALL the fonts. \textbf{Before sending it, test your PDF by
  printing it from a computer different from the one where it was
  created.} Moreover, some word processors may generate very large PDF
files, where each page is rendered as an image. Such images may
reproduce poorly. In this case, try alternative ways to obtain the
PDF. One way on some systems is to install a driver for a postscript
printer, send your document to the printer specifying ``Output to a
file'', then convert the file to PDF.

It is of utmost importance to specify the \textbf{A4 format} (21 cm
x 29.7 cm) when formatting the paper. When working with
{\tt dvips}, for instance, one should specify {\tt -t a4}.
Or using the command \verb|\special{papersize=210mm,297mm}| in the latex
preamble (directly below the \verb|\usepackage| commands). Then using 
{\tt dvipdf} and/or {\tt pdflatex} which would make it easier for some.

Print-outs of the PDF file on A4 paper should be identical to the
hardcopy version. If you cannot meet the above requirements about the
production of your electronic submission, please contact the
publication chairs as soon as possible.

\subsection{Layout}
\label{ssec:layout}

Format manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner these
instructions are formatted. The exact dimensions for a page on A4
paper are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Left and right margins: 2.5 cm
\item Top margin: 2.5 cm
\item Bottom margin: 2.5 cm
\item Column width: 7.7 cm
\item Column height: 24.7 cm
\item Gap between columns: 0.6 cm
\end{itemize}

\noindent Papers should not be submitted on any other paper size.
 If you cannot meet the above requirements about the production of 
 your electronic submission, please contact the publication chairs 
 above as soon as possible.

\subsection{Fonts}

For reasons of uniformity, Adobe's {\bf Times Roman} font should be
used. In \LaTeX2e{} this is accomplished by putting

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{latexsym}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
in the preamble. If Times Roman is unavailable, use {\bf Computer
  Modern Roman} (\LaTeX2e{}'s default).  Note that the latter is about
  10\% less dense than Adobe's Times Roman font.

\subsection{The First Page}
\label{ssec:first}

Center the title, author's name(s) and affiliation(s) across both
columns. Do not use footnotes for affiliations. Do not include the
paper ID number assigned during the submission process. Use the
two-column format only when you begin the abstract.

{\bf Title}: Place the title centered at the top of the first page, in
a 15-point bold font. (For a complete guide to font sizes and styles,
see Table~\ref{font-table}) Long titles should be typed on two lines
without a blank line intervening. Approximately, put the title at 2.5
cm from the top of the page, followed by a blank line, then the
author's names(s), and the affiliation on the following line. Do not
use only initials for given names (middle initials are allowed). Do
not format surnames in all capitals ({\em e.g.}, use ``Mitchell'' not
``MITCHELL'').  Do not format title and section headings in all
capitals as well except for proper names (such as ``BLEU'') that are
conventionally in all capitals.  The affiliation should contain the
author's complete address, and if possible, an electronic mail
address. Start the body of the first page 7.5 cm from the top of the
page.

The title, author names and addresses should be completely identical
to those entered to the electronical paper submission website in order
to maintain the consistency of author information among all
publications of the conference. If they are different, the publication
chairs may resolve the difference without consulting with you; so it
is in your own interest to double-check that the information is
consistent.

{\bf Abstract}: Type the abstract at the beginning of the first
column. The width of the abstract text should be smaller than the
width of the columns for the text in the body of the paper by about
0.6 cm on each side. Center the word {\bf Abstract} in a 12 point bold
font above the body of the abstract. The abstract should be a concise
summary of the general thesis and conclusions of the paper. It should
be no longer than 200 words. The abstract text should be in 10 point font.

{\bf Text}: Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after
the abstract, observing the two-column format as shown in 


the present document. Do not include page numbers.

{\bf Indent}: Indent when starting a new paragraph, about 0.4 cm. Use 11 points for text and subsection headings, 12 points for section headings and 15 points for the title.

\subsection{Sections}

{\bf Headings}: Type and label section and subsection headings in the
style shown on the present document.  Use numbered sections (Arabic
numerals) in order to facilitate cross references. Number subsections
with the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot,
in Arabic numerals.
Do not number subsubsections.

  }
\end{table*}

{\bf Citations}: Citations within the text appear in parentheses
as~\cite{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in the text
itself, as Gusfield~\shortcite{Gusfield:97}.
Using the provided \LaTeX\ style, the former is accomplished using
{\small\verb|\cite|} and the latter with {\small\verb|\shortcite|} or {\small\verb|\newcite|}. Collapse multiple citations as in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}; this is accomplished with the provided style using commas within the {\small\verb|\cite|} command, {\em e.g.}, {\small\verb|\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}|}. Append lowercase letters to the year in cases of ambiguities.  
 Treat double authors as
in~\cite{Aho:72}, but write as in~\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two
authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as
in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}. Also refrain from using full citations
as sentence constituents.

We suggest that instead of
\begin{quote}
  ``\cite{Gusfield:97} showed that ...''
\end{quote}
you use
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}   showed that ...''
\end{quote}

If you are using the provided \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files, you
can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text)
to get ``author (year)'' citations.

If the Bib\TeX{} file contains DOI fields, the paper
title in the references section will appear as a hyperlink
to the DOI, using the hyperref \LaTeX{} package.
To disable the hyperref package, load the style file
with the \verb|nohyperref| option: \\{\small
\verb|\usepackage[nohyperref]{naaclhlt2018}|}


\textbf{Digital Object Identifiers}:  As part of our work to make ACL
materials more widely used and cited outside of our discipline, ACL
has registered as a CrossRef member, as a registrant of Digital Object
Identifiers (DOIs), the standard for registering permanent URNs for
referencing scholarly materials.  As of 2017, we are requiring all
camera-ready references to contain the appropriate DOIs (or as a
second resort, the hyperlinked ACL Anthology Identifier) to all cited
works.  Thus, please ensure that you use Bib\TeX\ records that contain
DOI or URLs for any of the ACL materials that you reference.
Appropriate records should be found for most materials in the current
ACL Anthology at \url{http://aclanthology.info/}.

As examples, we cite \cite{P16-1001} to show you how papers with a DOI
will appear in the bibliography.  We cite \cite{C14-1001} to show how
papers without a DOI but with an ACL Anthology Identifier will appear
in the bibliography.  

As reviewing will be double-blind, the submitted version of the papers
should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the author's identity, {\em e.g.},
\begin{quote}
``We previously showed \cite{Gusfield:97} ...''  
\end{quote}
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as 
\begin{quote}
``\citeauthor{Gusfield:97} \shortcite{Gusfield:97}
previously showed ... ''
\end{quote}

Any preliminary non-archival versions of submitted papers should be listed in the submission form but not in the review version of the paper. NAACL-HLT 2018 reviewers are generally aware that authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other venues, but will not be provided the list of previous presentations from the submission form. 


\textbf{Please do not use anonymous citations} and do not include
 when submitting your papers. Papers that do not
conform to these requirements may be rejected without review.

\textbf{References}: Gather the full set of references together under
the heading {\bf References}; place the section before any Appendices,
unless they contain references. Arrange the references alphabetically
by first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.
Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format,
such as the one for {\em Computational Linguistics\/} or the one in the 
{\em Publication Manual of the American 
Psychological Association\/}~\cite{APA:83}. Use of full names for
authors rather than initials is preferred. A list of abbreviations
for common computer science journals can be found in the ACM 
{\em Computing Reviews\/}~\cite{ACM:83}.

The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly fit the
American Psychological Association format, allowing regular citations, 
short citations and multiple citations as described above.

Submissions should accurately reference prior and related work, including code and data. If a piece of prior work appeared in multiple venues, the version that appeared in a refereed, archival venue should be referenced. If multiple versions of a piece of prior work exist, the one used by the authors should be referenced. Authors should not rely on automated citation indices to provide accurate references for prior and related work.

{\bf Appendices}: Appendices, if any, directly follow the text and the
references (but see above).  Letter them in sequence and provide an
informative title: {\bf Appendix A. Title of Appendix}.

\subsection{Footnotes}

{\bf Footnotes}: Put footnotes at the bottom of the page and use 9
point font. They may be numbered or referred to by asterisks or other
symbols.\footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.} Footnotes
should be separated from the text by a line.\footnote{Note the line
separating the footnotes from the text.}

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
paper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns.  Color
illustrations are discouraged, unless you have verified that  
they will be understandable when printed in black ink.

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.''  Type the captions of the figures and 
tables below the body, using 11 point text.


\subsection{Accessibility}
\label{ssec:accessibility}

In an effort to accommodate people who are color-blind (as well as those printing
to paper), grayscale readability for all accepted papers will be
encouraged.  Color is not forbidden, but authors should ensure that
tables and figures do not rely solely on color to convey critical
distinctions. A simple criterion: All curves and points in your figures should be clearly distinguishable without color.

\section{Translation of non-English Terms}

It is also advised to supplement non-English characters and terms
with appropriate transliterations and/or translations
since not all readers understand all such characters and terms.
Inline transliteration or translation can be represented in
the order of: original-form transliteration ``translation''.

\section{Length of Submission}
\label{sec:length}

The NAACL-HLT 2018 main conference accepts submissions of long papers and
short papers.
 Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of
content plus unlimited pages for references. Upon acceptance, final
versions of long papers will be given one additional page -- up to nine (9)
pages of content plus unlimited pages for references -- so that reviewers' comments
can be taken into account. Short papers may consist of up to four (4)
pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references. Upon
acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) pages in the
proceedings and unlimited pages for references. 

For both long and short papers, all illustrations and tables that are part
of the main text must be accommodated within these page limits, observing
the formatting instructions given in the present document. Supplementary
material in the form of appendices does not count towards the page limit; see appendix A for further information.

However, note that supplementary material should be supplementary
(rather than central) to the paper, and that reviewers may ignore
supplementary material when reviewing the paper (see Appendix
\ref{sec:supplemental}). Papers that do not conform to the specified
length and formatting requirements are subject to be rejected without
review.

Workshop chairs may have different rules for allowed length and
whether supplemental material is welcome. As always, the respective
call for papers is the authoritative source.

\section{Supplemental Material}
\label{sec:supplemental}
Submissions may include resources (software and/or data) used in in the work and described in the paper. Papers that are submitted with accompanying software and/or data may receive additional credit toward the overall evaluation score, and the potential impact of the software and data will be taken into account when making the acceptance/rejection decisions. Any accompanying software and/or data should include licenses and documentation of research review as appropriate.


NAACL-HLT 2018 also encourages the submission of supplementary material to report preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details necessary for the replication of the experiments reported in the paper. Seemingly small preprocessing decisions can sometimes make a large difference in performance, so it is crucial to record such decisions to precisely characterize state-of-the-art methods. 

Nonetheless, supplementary material should be supplementary (rather
than central) to the paper. {\bf Submissions that misuse the supplementary 
material may be rejected without review.}
Essentially, supplementary material may include explanations or details
of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of
features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system,
pseudo-code or source code, and data. (Source code and data should
be separate uploads, rather than part of the paper).

The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper
may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to the
reviewers, they will not be asked to review the
supplementary material.


Appendices ({\em i.e.} supplementary material in the form of proofs, tables,
or pseudo-code) should come after the references, as shown here. Use
\verb|\appendix| before any appendix section to switch the section
numbering over to letters.

\section{Multiple Appendices}
\dots can be gotten by using more than one section. We hope you won't
need that.
